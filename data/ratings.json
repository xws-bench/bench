    "ships":{
	"X-Wing":"The T-65 X-wing is the Rebel’s standard ship in the game. It is an effective jouster with its X-wing only modification and an equipped astromech upgrade card. While there are occasional instances where other modifications would help, the Integrated Astromech modification should always be strongly considered for that slot. The X-wing fits into a Rebel squad similarly to how a B-wing does. The two ships have numerous small differences, however. The X-wing’s defense is less consistent (but has approximately the same average defense) and it has an overall better dial but has a lack of 1 speed turns. The X-wing will almost always have the benefit of an astromech upgrade, but the B-Wing has the barrel roll. All in all, this makes the X-wing a faster and more mobile fighter, while the B-wing is a better knife fighter. The generic X-wings are the most effective jousters, while the named X-wing pilots offer some of the strongest abilities in the game, so they definitely have a place in a competitive squad.",
	"Y-Wing":"The Rebel Y-wing is a staple of the Rebel fleet. It is a highly customizable ship, capable of filling many different rolls within a squad. Without upgrades, a naked Y-wing is a decent jousting ship, but with the BTL-A4 Y-Wing upgrade, plus a turret upgrade, it becomes a very formidable jousting ship. It can also serve well as a support craft via its turret upgrade (without BTL) allowing it to strike at enemy ships outside of its firing arc. The Y-wing has a poor dial, so careful maneuvering is essential if these ships are to be successful. The R2 Astromech upgrade can help with its poor dial to an extent though. A squad containing a large amount of BTL-A4 Y-Wings can lay down a fearsome amount of firepower and should be avoided at all costs. Also, the Y-wing can be equipped with a Bomb Loadout, allowing it to enhance its high firepower with the additional threat of bombs.",
	"A-Wing":"The A-wing was designed as a direct response to the Empire’s new TIE Interceptor. The A-wing fills a similar role in a squad, being slightly heartier and faster than its Imperial counterpart, but not being quite as maneuverable or having the same firepower. The A-wing’s dial is fantastic, having a ton of green options and having every turn maneuver allows it to shred stress at a high rate, making it a natural choice for Push the Limit. A-wings are the only ship in the game that can equip multiple EPT upgrade cards, allowing for unprecedented combinations of EPTs. Also, the A-wing can be equipped with a Chardaan Refit in the event that you do not want to carry a missile. A-wings are at their best when dodging as much enemy fire as possible and striking without return fire. Therefore, they are the Rebellon’s best Arc Dodging ship available to them, especially when they utilize Autothrusters. The A-wing is very playable no matter what PS you choose to bring to the rest of the squad, but its recommended that some jousting or Turret ships join your squad to help compensate for the A-wing’s weaknesses. Low PS A-Wings make for great blockers with their boost action.",
	"YT-1300":"The YT-1300 is the only ship in the game that has wildly different stats for its two generic pilots. The Outer Rim Smuggler is not very effective for its points, but the Resistance Sympathizer can hold its own like the unique YT-1300s. Properly equipped, a YT-1300 is very tanky and hits hard. For a large base ship, the YT-1300 is also quite maneuverable, boasting the coveted 1 turns. Generic YT-1300s can act primarily as massive blockers and should utilize upgrades to capitalize on that. The named YT-1300s should equip numerous upgrades to bolster their resilience, attack power, and or maneuverability, as a naked YT-1300 is a poor ship. The YT-1300 is also unique in that its unique title, Millennium Falcon, comes in two different versions. One title (original trilogy) grants the evade action, which is usually the better choice for YT-1300s built for defense. The other title (New Republic trilogy) works best with YT-1300s that like to keep enemies in arc, like Rey. In addition, the Smuggling Compartment Modification grants the coveted illicit upgrade to the ship, offering it even greater customization.",
	"B-Wing":"The B-wing is a workhorse of the Rebel fleet. Alongside the X-wing, the B-wing boasts a very efficient stat-line making it one of the game’s best jousting ships. On top of that, the B-wing has the barrel roll action, and a well-rounded upgrade bar to boot. The B-wing is not without weaknesses, however, as its maneuver dial, while not poor, is not that great either. A 2 speed K-Turn is usually worse than longer K-Turns, as it does not allow the B-wing to clear the clutter of ships that tends to be the board state the turn before a K-Turn is needed. The generic pilots tend to fair the best, as their raw efficiency is worth more at low PS. The sensor upgrade slot is often used for Advanced Sensors or Fire-Control System, and Heavy Laser Cannons are usually the cannon of choice when equipping one. Additionally, the B-wing only modification allows the B-wing to equip a crew upgrade card, which allows for even more customization.",
	"HWK-290":"The HWK-290 is the Rebel support ship. The named pilots all offer unique abilities that augment the rest of your squad to great effect. The HWK itself is a rather pitiful ship, being the only ship in the game with only 1 attack. However, it can host numerous upgrades that make the ship much more powerful. While a squad rarely needs more than one HWK, a well piloted HWK using its support ability can be exceptionally powerful. The HWK does not have a K-Turn and it melts to continuous fire, so good HWK pilots know to skirt the boarder of the battlefield to avoid taking too much fire. The Moldy Crow is a very good upgrade that works with a few other upgrades and named pilot abilities.",
	"Z-95 Headhunter":"The Z-95 Headhunter is the Rebellion’s low cost jousting ship. It is relatively tied for efficiency against the Empire’s TIE Fighter. The Z-95’s low cost and solid stat-line allows it to be included into a wide variety of lists. Most of the time, the generic pilots are best when flown in mass quantities in formation. While a Z-95 swarm is not quite as effective in terms of offense as a TIE swarm led by Howlrunner, Z-95s tend to last longer on the battlefield as they are a little sturdier. In addition to being a cheap filler ship, the Z-95 also can serve as an ordnance platform, especially when flown in high numbers. Therefore, a squad of Z-95s with a tracer missile and other ordnance options can lay waste to multiple enemy ships in a powerful alpha strike. The named pilots also are very good, and can be incorporated as part of a squad even if other jousting ships are not present.",
	"E-Wing":"The E-wing is a cross between the X-wing and the A-wing. It boasts the best aspects of both aforementioned ships in terms of offense, defense, agility, and maneuverability. However, the E-wing is slightly over-costed for what it brings to a squad, especially at lower PS. Therefore, the generic E-wings [currently] do not have much of a place in a competitive squad. However, the named E-wings definitely can make it into competitive squads where their higher PS and abilities compensate for their lack of jousting efficiency. The E-wing is the only ship to boast both a systems upgrade AND an astromech upgrade, allowing for numerous unique combinations of upgrades. Building and piloting an E-wing can be tricky, but their adaptability and customizability can be worth it in the right squad.",
	"YT-2400":"The YT-2400 is a lighter variant of the YT-1300. The YT-2400 lacks the durability and firepower of the YT-1300, but it is more agile, has a better maneuver dial, and has the barrel roll action. In addition, YT-2400s can take a cannon upgrade to augment their relatively mediocre stat-line. In addition, the unique title upgrade for the YT- 2400, the Outrider (Dash Rendar’s personal modified YT-2400), allows an equipped cannon upgrade to fire in a 360 degree firing arc, at the cost of being unable to utilize its primary weapon any more. Bear in mind, that the YT-2400 does not need the Outrider title to make its cannon upgrades worthwhile. All of the YT-2400 pilots are viable depending on the rest of the squad; they perform best when they can dodge as many enemy arcs as possible with their barrel roll action. The Smuggling Compartment upgrade grants further utility to the YT-2400 upgrade bar.",
	"VCX-100":"The VCX-100 is without a doubt, one of the most unique ships in the game. It is one of two ships with a 4 dice attack, it combines the sensor slot with the option to have a turret upgrade, it can fire torpedoes out of its auxiliary arc, and it even lacks agility. What makes it so unique, however, is its interaction with the Attack Shuttle. With the Ghost title equipped to the VCX-100, an attack shuttle can be docked to the VCX-100 which allows the VCX-100 to fire primary weapons out of its rear arc. In addition, with both titles equipped, at the end of the Combat Phase, the VCX-100 may attack with an equipped turret upgrade. While the Attack Shuttle is not necessary to dock to the VCX-100, it does greatly increase the lethality of the ship. With the wide variety of VCX-100 pilots, crew members, and possible Attack Shuttle pilots, the VCX-100 is an extremely versatile, customizable, and formidable craft.",
	"Attack Shuttle":"The Attack Shuttle, like its VCX-100 counterpart, is a very unique ship. First of all, it is one of only two classes of ships that does not have a generic pilot. Also, it can be docked onto the VCX-100 using its unique title, augmenting the VCX- 100’s abilities until the Attack Shuttle is deployed. The Attack Shuttle is able to be fielded independently from the VCX- 100 in lists without its Ghost counterpart, however, so it pays to address its individual strengths and weaknesses independently of the Ghost. The Attack Shuttle is a glass cannon, similar to the TIE Interceptor. The Attack Shuttle can hit hard, but withers to any significant enemy fire; fortunately, the Attack Shuttle has the barrel roll action, which grants it some arc dodging potential, which is unique for ships that have the turret upgrade. Its turret upgrade allows for the Attack Shuttle to avoid the direct combat that is likely to result in its deletion. If the Attack Shuttle can be kept out of harm’s way, while continuing to get shots on the opponent, the ship with easily earn its worth much more than its point value.",
	"ARC-170":"The ARC-170 is a repurposed Clone-Wars era Starfighter used by the Rebel Alliance. To showcase this modification by the Rebel Alliance, the ship has a zero cost title that is intended to ALWAYS be equipped to the ship, which strengthens the ship and keeps it up to date in terms of combat standards for the time period. The ARC-170 is a formidable support platform, combining the strength of the crew and astromech upgrades onto the same ship. In addition, it is one of the few small base ships that has a rear-facing auxiliary firing arc, which adds to the flexibility of the ship. Because the ship was not mass produced for the Rebel Alliance, there were only a handful that were utilized during the Galactic Civil War. Therefore, there are only unique pilots available for this ship (no generic pilots). These pilots boast interesting support abilities that can be further augmented by the power that can be derived from combining crew and astromech upgrades together. The maneuver dial for the ARC-170 is average and showcases the ship’s desire to maneuver at slow speeds due to its six green one and two speed maneuvers. The ship is not without downsides though, as it is not incredibly tanky for the price paid for the ship, so it is necessary to make use of its auxiliary firing arc and its unique upgrade bar to maximum effect.",
	"K-Wing":"The K-wing is the Rebel’s heavy bomber and can fill a variety of different roles in a squad. It is the only ship in the game with the SLAM action, making it a very versatile bomber (when equipped with Advanced SLAM) and it can escape enemy firing arcs with surprising speed. It is also the only small base ship in the game with a PWT. In addition, the K-wing can take a stunning number of upgrades including a crew and turret upgrade. While the K-wing is a highly adaptable and customizable ship, it does not come cheap, and its maneuver dial is not the greatest, as it lacks a K-Turn. The K-wing is the ultimate bomber with Advanced SLAM. Try and avoid enemy arcs as much as possible with the K-wing, whether you are using it as an ordnance platform, bomber, or turret weapon; luckily, the SLAM action allows you to avoid those arcs with relative ease.",
	"U-Wing":"The U-wing is similar to the Imperial Lambda-Class Shuttle; it primarily serves as a support ship, but it has a high jousting value that is off-set by poor maneuverability. While the U-wing costs two more squad points than its Imperial counterpart, the U- wing has a stronger maneuver dial, and zero cost title (Pivot Wing) that further augments its maneuverability. Due to its free title (that should always be equipped), the U-wing actually boasts 2 agility, but it can reduce that agility to be able to rotate its base 180 degrees during a 0-speed maneuver. The title is a dual card that may be flipped after executing a maneuver. The U-wing is currently the only Rebel ship that has a 0-speed maneuver. The U-wing’s strongest asset is its upgrade bar, as it will often be loaded up with crew and systems upgrades to help bolster the rest of its squad. The main weakness of the U-wing is that it is not extremely maneuverable and it only has a forward firing arc for a large base ship, so it can sometimes be difficult to get shots on target, and the U-wing is relatively easy to focus fire. The Blue Squadron Pathfinder is an excellent choice when a low-cost support ship is needed in a squad.",
	"Z-95 Headhunter (SCUM)":"The Z-95 Headhunter is the workhorse of the Scum faction; it differs from its Rebel counterpart in a reduction of PS but the inclusion of the Illicit upgrade slot. It is relatively tied for efficiency against the Empire’s TIE Fighter. The Z-95’s low cost and solid stat-line allows it to be included into a wide variety of lists. Most of the time, the generic pilots are best when flown in mass quantities in formation. While a Z-95 swarm is not quite as effective in terms of offense as a TIE swarm led by Howlrunner, Z-95s tend to last longer on the battlefield as they are a little sturdier. In addition to being a cheap filler ship, the Z-95 also can serve as an ordnance platform, especially when flown in high numbers. The named pilots also are very good, and can be incorporated as part of a squad even if other jousting ships are not present.",
	"Y-Wing (SCUM)":"The Scum Y-wing is almost identical to its Rebel counterpart, except that it has a Salvaged Astromech upgrade slot instead of the Rebel’s Astromech upgrade. It is a highly customizable ship, capable of filling many different rolls within a squad. Without upgrades, a naked Y-wing is a decent jousting ship, but with the BTL-A4 Y-wing upgrade, plus a turret upgrade, it becomes a very formidable jousting ship. It can also serve well as a support craft via its turret upgrade (without BTL) allowing it to strike at enemy ships outside of its firing arc. The Y-wing has a poor dial, so careful maneuvering is essential if these ships are to be successful. The Unhinged Astromech upgrade can help with its poor dial to an extent though. A squad containing a large amount of BTL-A4 Y-wings can lay down a fearsome amount of firepower and should be avoided at all costs. Also, the Y-wing can be equipped with a Bomb Loadout, allowing it to enhance its high firepower with the additional threat of bombs.",
	"M3-A Interceptor (SCUM)":"The M3-A Interceptor (Also known as the Scyk Interceptor) has the second lowest squad point cost in the game. While not an efficient jouster, the 2 additional points a Cartel Spacer costs over an Academy Pilot gets a shield instead of a hull, the target lock action, an additional PS, and a slightly better maneuver dial. Even with these upgrades, the Scyk is not designed for jousting the opponent. While higher PS ships can serve as softer arc dodgers, the real value in a Scyk comes from its access to the “Heavy Scyk Interceptor” title, which allows you to equip a cannon upgrade (equipping a torpedo or missile upgrade is an option too, but it is rarely worth it). With this upgrade, the Scyk turns into the ultimate glass cannon, unleashing attacks from the games very powerful cannons, while having excruciatingly low defense. Because of this, the best way to pilot a Scyk is to hang out on the outskirts of the fight, using 1 banks to stay at range 3 of the opponent for as long as possible, and then using the 5 K-Turn to reset for another attack at range 3. The Scyk is a difficult ship to pilot effectively, as a single error can prove to be its destruction, but piloted well it is well worth its points. A hull upgrade can help compensate for the Scyk’s fragility.",
	"Aggressor (SCUM)":"IG88s’ Aggressors are the most unique ships in the game. There are no generic pilots, and each IG-88 pilot has the same squad point cost. Each ship has the boost action (unique to a large base ship), three agility (also unique to a large base ship), and an expansive upgrade bar. All this upside is offset by its forward firing arc. The Ig-88s are very difficult to fly, as keeping their large base forward firing arcs in arc is not easy, as is trying to arc dodge at the same time. In addition, the IG-2000 title allows two “bro-bots” to link their abilities across both ships. It is best to fly the Aggressor as an arc dodger, but with only six PS, it needs to be able to function without as good of an arc dodging ability as well. Each IG has its own strengths and weaknesses, so learning how to combine their abilities and utilize them properly are necessary to succeed with them.",
"Kihraxz Fighter (SCUM)":"The Kihraxz Fighter is the Scum’s version of the X-Wing. The Kihraxz is a less efficient jouster than the X-Wing, but it is a little cheaper, has the illicit slot, and is a better knife fighter. The Kihraxz has a stronger dial overall, but lacks the 3- speed turn. The best use for a Kihraxz is in squads that really need a mid-twenty cost ship to round out their list. That being said, the Kihraxz is a good knife-fighter that maneuvers well in the range 1 band. Access to the illicit upgrade gives a lot of utility to the ship as a whole. The Black Sun Ace generic pilot can be a very valuable addition to a squad with its high PS and EPT. The Kihraxz will melt to concentrated firepower, so it is important to have more threatening members of your squad to draw fire away from the Kihraxz.",
	"StarViper (SCUM)":"The StarViper is the Scum version of a Tie Interceptor or A-Wing. The StarViper is more expensive and more durable, however, at the cost of some green maneuvers. While the StarViper cannot K-Turn, it has access to be overall stronger maneuver called the Segnor’s Loop. The StarViper is one of the few ships that is able to perform this rare but flexible maneuver. These abilities cause the StarViper to be the Scum’s primary arc dodger. In addition, the StarViper has access to a unique title upgrade card called the Virago. This upgrade grants the StarViper a systems upgrade AND an illicit upgrade, granting the ship a wealth of options to optimize its performance. While the StarViper is sturdier than its Rebel and Imperial counterparts, it should still try and rely on positioning and outmaneuvering the opponent to perform optimally. Without an evade action, the StarViper is much more aggressive than the A-Wing or Interceptor, and that needs to be taken into account when squad building and flying the ship.",
	"JumpMaster 5000 (SCUM)":"The JumpMaster 5000 is one of the most customizable ships in the game. It is also the only ship in the game to have an asymmetrical maneuver dial which allows the ship greater maneuverability when going to the left. The JumpMaster has a wide variety of builds including ordnance carrier, “fat” turret, support ship, and/or tank. This versatility is mostly due to its expansive upgrade bar, being the only ship in the game that has the salvaged astromech upgrade slot alongside crew and illicit upgrades. In addition to its excellent (if not unorthodox) maneuver dial, the Jumpmaster has access to the barrel roll action, granting the ship greater positioning options. The Contracted Scout is a very cost effective platform for a variety of builds especially due to its EPT, but without upgrades, its two dice attack is not very effective. Fortunately, the unique title allows the JumpMaster to increase its primary weapon dice by one. While this title is stronger on the higher PS JumpMasters, the Punishing One title can definitely make up for its high cost.",
"Lancer-class Pursuit Craft (SCUM)":"The Lancer-Class Pursuit Craft is the only ship in the game currently to have a mobile firing arc and the “rotate arc” action. This ship functions best when patrolling the perimeter of the battlefield, keeping its mobile firing arc facing towards the middle. This ship also moves very fast, with most of its green maneuvers being 3 speed. Having the evade action provides a lot of resiliency to this ship, especially when augmented with upgrades. Also, the Lancer-Class Pursuit Craft is the only ship to have access to two illicit slots, which allows the ship to have a number of unique customizability options. In addition, the Lancer-Class Pursuit Craft’s unique title, the Shadow Caster, assigns tractor beam tokens to the enemy ship. This ship equipped with its title tends to operate best when it is the highest PS ship in the squad, so that other ships in the squad will fire at the tractor beamed target with reduced agility. This ship also has a unique modification that allows the ship to rotate its mobile firing arc for free at the end of the turn. The Lancer-Class Pursuit Craft has a few weaknesses, of course, which are similar to most PWT weakness. This ship wants to avoid as much fire as possible, as it does not do well under sustained fire, but it lacks any repositioning actions, which are less good on this ship as the highest PS pilot is a 7.",
"Protectorate Starfighter (SCUM)":"The Protectorate Starfighter is the Scum’s premier Arc-Dodger class ship, similar to the Rebel’s A-wing and the Imperial’s TIE Interceptor. The Protectorate Starfighter has the fewest green maneuvers of those three ships, but it has access to two 2-speed talon rolls, which definitely compensates for the loss of green maneuvers at higher speeds. This ship is very attuned to utilizing Push the Limit, much more than most other Scum ships. One facet of the Protectorate Starfighter is that it has access to a title that grants it additional defenses when jousting an enemy ship at range 1, which is thematically called the Concordia Face Off maneuver. While the title does cost one point, it allows the Protectorate Starfighter to shift between a pure arc-dodger to a make-shift jouster when the game-state allows it. As with other interceptor-type ships, the Protectorate Starfighter is very fragile, and wilts under sustained fire. Even though its title grants it some protection when jousting, it should only do so when necessary and only against one ship at a time, as a bad stroke of luck can result in the Protectorate Starfighter taking some heavy damage. Also, without access to the evade action, the Protectorate Starfighter tends to be the more aggressive of the three faction’s interceptor-type ships, leveraging superior positioning and its title instead of sitting behind a stack of defense tokens. Both its PS 3 and PS 5 generic pilots have an EPT, which makes them effective users of Push the Limit. The PS 1 pilot can be an effective blocker.",
	"G-1A Starfighter (SCUM)":"The G-1A Starfighter is a heavy assault fighter similar to the Rebel B-wing. The G-1A Starfighter is highly customizable with access to crew, sensor, and illicit upgrade slots, and the ship is usually at its best when implementing these interactions. While the G-1A Starfighter is an efficient jouster, it is not without downsides. It’s maneuver dial is poor and predicable, and without superior maneuvering abilities, it can be easily flanked. The generic G-1A Starfighters also pay a premium for its naturally higher PS, they are sometimes inefficient if the opponent plays higher PS. The unique title Misthunter grants the barrel roll action to the G-1A Starfighter, granting some more maneuverability to the ship, as well as equipping a tractor beam. Because of the Misthunter title and its effectiveness, most scum squads tend to field only one G-1A Starfighter.",
	"YV-666 (SCUM)":"The YV-666 is the Scum version of the Lambda Space Cow. The YV-666 has a slightly better dial, more hit points, and a higher point cost. The YV-666 also has two auxiliary firing arcs which forms a 180 degree arc in the front half of the ship. Also, having three crew upgrade slots and an illicit upgrade slot combine with the rest of the ship’s attributes to make it quite formidable. The YV-666 can be built to hit very hard, but it also melts to continuous fire. With its unique title, the Hound’s Tooth, it can deploy a Z-95 onto the battlefield when destroyed. This is quite a bargain, as a 6 point Z-95 is incredibly cheap; however, its squad must be designed to encourage the opponent to destroy the YV-666 as fast as possible to get the maximum benefit out of the Z-95. The YV-666 also has access to the Maneuvering Fins modification, which if an Engine Upgrade is too expensive for the list, is a good alternative to help with positioning.",
	"HWK-290 (SCUM)":"The HWK-290 is the Scum support ship. What differs from the Rebel HWK-290s is  the addition of the illicit upgrade slot at the cost of PS. In addition, the Scum named HWK pilots are focused on inflicting corrosive effects to the opponent, as opposed to helping the rest of your squad perform better. The HWK itself is a rather pitiful ship, being the only ship in the game with only 1 attack. However, it can host numerous upgrades that make the ship much more powerful. While a squad rarely needs more than one HWK, a well piloted HWK using its support ability can be exceptionally powerful. The HWK does not have a K-Turn and it melts to continuous fire, so good HWK pilots know to skirt the boarder of the battlefield to avoid taking too much fire. The Moldy Crow is a very good upgrade that works with a few other upgrades and named pilot abilities.",
	"Firespray-31 (SCUM)":"While not really a turret, the Firespray has a rear firing arc, which is treated as a primary firing arc (but it cannot fire secondary weapons from it). This rear arc makes the Firespray a unique ship, somewhere between a jouster and a turret ship, so it is difficult to classify. Its upgrades allow for a lot of customizing and there are a lot of ways to bring a Firespray into a Scum squad. In order for a Firespray to be effective, it needs to avoid as many enemy arcs as possible, so its rear arc remains relevant long into the end game. The main difference between Imperial and Scum Firesprays is that the Empire favors efficiency while the Scum prefer higher quality ships. This is evident when you compare the two generic Firesprays between the two factions.",
	"T-70 X-Wing":"The T-70 X-wing is an upgraded version of the classic T-65 X-wing. While the T-65 excels jousting, the T-70 sacrifices some jousting proficiency to gain a stronger maneuver dial, the boost action, and access to the tech upgrade. The T-70 is currently the only ship in the game that has the Talon Roll maneuver, which grants it a unique option in a dogfight. While the Segnor’s loop is more-or-less a glorified K-Turn, the Talon Roll grants the T-70 a degree of adjustability to its flying that no other ship can quite match. In terms of modifications, while the T-65 requires an astromech upgrade with Integrated Astromech to be effective, the T-70 has options. The Integrated Astromech is a fine option, but since the T-70 as the boost action, it can equip Autothrusters. The lower PS T-70s tend to prefer Integrated Astromech while higher PS pilots usually opt for Autothursters. While the T-65 is more of a “filler” ship, the T-70 performs better at higher PS, and is best flown as a “jousting-arc dodger” of sorts. The T-70 X-wing has a unique title called Black One which is a situationally useful card. Usually this title does not see play unless the squad considering it has a free point available.",
	"TIE Punisher":"The TIE Punisher does really only does a couple of things well. It is an excellent missile, torpedo, and bomb platform. With its expansive upgrade bar (which includes a systems upgrade slot) the TIE Punisher can be outfitted to sport a plethora of ordnance options. There is an ordnance for almost every situation, so figuring out which ordnance is best for your squad depends on its inherent weaknesses and strengths. With the boost action, the TIE Punisher can adjust its heading for optimal bomb placement. Regardless of the loadout, the Extra Munitions upgrade is almost a necessity to make this ship perform optimally. The lower PS Punishers are more equipped to drop mines while the high PS ships are more equipped to drop bombs and unleash missiles and torpedoes. Lower PS Punishers are inefficient for their cost (so TIE Bombers fill the role of low PS bombers/ordnance carriers), but the named Punishers are better.",
	"TIE/FO Fighter":"The TIE/fo Fighter is an upgraded version of its predecessor, the TIE Fighter. As such, the TIE/fo boasts superior shielding, maneuverability, has the TL action, and can equip the advanced tech upgrades. With all of these upgrades, the TIE/fo is more expensive than its TIE Fighter cousin. Because of these differences between the two classes of ships, the TIE/fo is a better knife fighter and arc dodger than the TIE Fighter, while the original TIE fighter is the superior jouster. The TIE/fo is the only Imperial ship to sport the 2-speed Segnor’s loop which can make the TIE/fo extremely unpredictable and nimble. Using a Segnor’s loop followed by a 2-speed turn maneuver showcases just how agile this fighter really is. While the TIE/fo is definitely a strong ship, it does have a few significant drawbacks, as higher PS pilots have increased costs for a ship with only a 2 dice attack and relatively weak defenses. This ship is not the best jouster, but it also is not the best arc dodger, making the ship very adaptable and well-rounded, but it will find itself outclassed by ships that specialize in those 2 pillars. All three generic squadrons have a place in a competitive squad, due to the advantages varying PS can have, as well as the Omega Squadron Pilot’s EPT.",
	"TIE Fighter":"The TIE fighter is tied (pun) for the most efficient ship in the game. The maneuver dial is very good, having all six turn maneuvers, but the TIE cannot move very slowly, as it lacks the 1 forward and 1 banks. The Academy Pilot is a very popular choice when flying an Imperial Swarm list. The TIE fighter is best flown in formation in high numbers. The Obsidian Squadron Pilot is effective in 7-8 TIE swarm lists to vary the PS. The Black Squadron Pilot is effective as he can use his Elite Pilot Talent (EPT) to great effect. Generic TIE Fighters rarely deserve any upgrades, although the Black Squadron Pilot has a few options for effective EPTs.",
	"TIE Advanced":"The TIE Advanced is a unique ship, in that its title allows it to equip a sensor upgrade at reduced cost. There are multiple effective options to choose from. Accuracy Corrector (AC) is the most obvious and popular choice, as it allows the TIE Advanced to use its actions either positionally or defensively. Fire-Control System (FCS) is another option that performs better at punching through agility 3+ targets than AC does at range 1, but it leaves the TIE Advanced more vulnerable defensively, and is less effective at ranges 2-3. Advanced Targeting Computer and to a lesser degree, Advanced Sensors, are both effective upgrades on higher PS pilots. Finally, to get the best in defensive performance, the sensor jammer works very well at buffing the survivability of the TIE Advanced. The TIE Advanced tends to prefer the range 3 band and it has an average dial. Of the two generic pilots, the Tempest Squadron Pilot is usually the most cost effective choice, but the Storm Squadron Pilot performs much better against lower PS targets.",
	"TIE Interceptor":"The TIE Interceptor is the definition of a glass cannon. It hits very hard, but also is easily destroyed. The TIE Interceptor is one of the few ships with both boost and barrel roll, so it is one of (if not THE) best arc dodgers in the game. Interceptors are not very customizable, at least at lower pilot skills. High PS ships have access to the Royal Guard TIE title upgrade, which allows the TIE to equip an additional modification. Also, the Royal Guard Pilot is tied for the highest PS ship in the game that is not a unique pilot. Alpha Squadron Pilots are very effective blockers, while Saber Squadron Pilots and Royal Guard Pilots can equip the extremely valuable Elite Pilot Talent (EPT). The Avenger Squadron Pilot is a fringe pilot, as it is only worth it against very specific matchups. The TIE Interceptor’s dial is one of the best in the game, making it extremely maneuverable. Lastly, the TIE interceptor should strongly consider the Autothrusters upgrade, as it helps with its survivability against its greatest weakness: turret weapons.",
	"Firespray-31":"While not really a turret, the Firespray has a rear firing arc, which is treated as a primary firing arc (but it cannot fire secondary weapons from it). This rear arc makes the Firespray a unique ship, somewhere between a jouster and a turret ship, so it is difficult to classify. Its upgrades allow for a lot of customizing and there are a lot of ways to bring a Firespray into an imperial squad. In order for a Firespray to be effective, it needs to avoid as many enemy arcs as possible, so its rear arc remains relevant long into the end game.",
	"TIE Defender":"The TIE Defender is the Imperial Navy’s most powerful TIE variant. With high speed, firepower, resiliency, and agility, the TIE Defender is a true terror in dogfighting combat. The TIE Defender is the only small base ship with a white K-Turn, which allows it to loop back and forth. While the white K-Turn offers the Defender a powerful maneuvering option, the rest of its dial is somewhat limiting for a ship of its caliber. The TIE Defender has two options for titles, and due to the high cost of the base Defender, using a title is a necessary. The TIE/x7 title is the more consistent option, as the survivability of the ship is greatly increased as long as the Defender maintains a high speed. The TIE/x7 actually reduces the cost of the ship as well, while removing some of the customizability of the Defender’s upgrade bar. The TIE/D radically amps up the firepower of the TIE Defender and making it capable of utilizing a control element. The TIE/D is higher risk, but higher reward in comparison to the TIE/x7. Generally, use the TIE/x7 if the Defender is the most threatening ship in your list. Use the TIE/D if the other ships in your list deserve more respect from the opponent, or if you want to combine multiple control elements into your list, such as multiple Defenders with TIE/D.",
	"TIE Phantom":"The TIE Phantom is one of the most unique ships in the game. It places a high priority on high PS using the cloak action with Advanced Cloaking Device (ACD). Cloak allows for unparalleled movement at the beginning of the Activation Phase. The Phantom is very difficult to pilot as well, as any slight misjudgment in flying can result in its demise. Also, the Phantom is one of the few ships with 4 attack dice, pushing its offensive abilities beyond what most ships’ agility dice can withstand. Due to its reliance on its ability to cloak after attacking, the Phantom relies heavily on its agility dice to survive, making its survivability somewhat inconsistent. Lower PS TIE Phantom pilots may choose to rely on the Stigium Particle Accelerator for added resiliency. IF the Phantom can utilize these two cards effectively, their jousting ability skyrockets, but without those abilities, their jousting ranking is modest. The most fearsome TIE Phantom pilots are the unique ones, equipped with the Veteran Instincts upgrade and ACD.",
	"TIE Bomber":"The TIE Bomber is a cheap ordnance platform that is designed to launch torpedoes, missiles, and bombs. Of the three generic pilots, the Scimitar is most useful to massed torpedo/missile volleys and/or bomb deployment. The Gamma Squadron Veterans can be much more frightening when their EPT is utilized effectively (Crackshot is a great choice with munitions). These munitions hit harder than normal weapons, at the cost of ease of use. By default, these kinds of weapons are slightly over-costed, so measures must be taken into account to off-set these natural disadvantages. Make sure to take advantage of the Extra Munitions upgrade to off-set the high cost of munitions and to use either Guidance Chips or Long-Range Scanners to most effectively utilize those weapons. TIE Bombers do not need to ordnance or bombs to be effective though. The low PS TIE Bombers are efficient jousters, and flown in high numbers showcase an impressive amount of health. In addition, the TIE Shuttle title completely alters the configuration of the TIE Bomber’s upgrade bar, allowing the ship to serve a completely different roll in a squad. Darth Vader, Mara Jade, and Tactician are all great choices when fielding a TIE Shuttle.",
	"Lambda-Class Shuttle":"The Lambda (or Space Cow) is the Imperial support ship. It is similar to the Rebel U-wing, but it is cheaper and less maneuverable. It is incredibly cheap for its stat line but its obvious glaring weakness is its horrible maneuver dial. In order to successfully utilize the Imperial Shuttle, pilots must be sure to fly with careful precision, as there is no room for error. While its dial is poor, the Lambda is one of the few ships with a “zero” maneuver, which can often catch enemies off guard. The Shuttle is often used as a support ship, and the unique pilots highlight that ability. The unique title for the Lambda can assist munitions builds.",
	"VT-49 Decimator":"The Decimator is the Empire's only access to a primary weapon turret ship, so it adds a lot of value to the faction. It is also unique in its zero agility and massive hit points along with having access to three crew members. The Decimator is one of the few ships without a K-Turn or any red maneuvers. Because of its high cost, the Decimator is best when it is equipped with numerous upgrades to maximize its offensive and defensive potential. Higher PS pilots should strongly consider Engine Upgrade for positioning against jousting lists. The Decimator will get shredded if it finds itself in multiple arcs each turn, and critical hits pile up on this ship, so trying to elude enemy arcs is pivotal in the success of Decimator pilots.",
	"TIE Striker":"The TIE Striker is a solid, mid-point cost ship for the empire. It boasts three attack dice for relatively few points, making it the empire’s cheapest 3-attack ship. With only two agility and four hull, the TIE Striker is a fragile craft, so pilots need to take care to avoid enemy arcs as much as possible. The TIE Striker has access to the barrel roll and evade actions, which help mitigate the relatively meager defenses of the ship. The TIE Striker has no upgrade slots, excluding the EPT on high PS ships, but it does have access to its zero cost title, Adaptive Ailerons. While it is not technically an auto-include (as it has a downside), its upsides almost always warrant its inclusion on the ship. Adaptive Ailerons allows the TIE Striker to move very fast if it is not stressed, and it allows great flexibility in its final position, making the TIE Striker a very slippery target especially at higher PS. The ship’s maneuver dial is also exceptional. It has a lot of low speed green maneuvers and access to 2-speed S-Loops; the only real downside of the maneuver dial is that it lacks the 3-speed turn, and that sometimes having 2-speed “turn around” maneuvers makes it hard to turn around in crowded airspace. The movement from Adaptive Ailerons can be blocked by the opponent, but if your normal maneuver is not blocked, you still get an action, which makes TIE Strikers VERY difficult to block effectively. The Imperial Trainee is an effective and threatening blocker, the Scarif Defender preys on lower PS ships, and the Black Squadron Scout grants the ability to take an EPT for a two point tax.",
	"TIE Adv. Prototype":"The TIE Advanced Prototype (TAP for short) is a highly maneuverable knife-fighter. The TAP is very similar to the Rebel’s A-Wing, with a few noticeable differences. TAPs naturally have the barrel roll and boost maneuvers making it only one of two total ships in the game that possess these two actions natively (the other ship is the TIE Interceptor). The TAP has a very good maneuver dial that excels at 1-speed maneuvers. Therefore, the TAP excels as a knife-fighter, as opposed to A-Wings and TIE Interceptors which tend to operate more effectively doing speed 2 maneuvers. The TAP is very fragile, so it is best to utilize this ship dodging arcs at close range, so it does not take too much fire. The TAP’s unique title allows the ship to take a free evade action when taking a target lock. This allows the TAPs to have access to each basic action, although because the title requires a successful target lock to work, it favors pilots with higher pilot skill. Of the two generic pilots, the Baron of the Empire has access to an EPT slot, which allows for greater customization.",
	"TIE/SF Fighter":"The TIE/sf Fighter is an elite version of the more standard TIE/fo Fighter. The TIE/sf trades some of its maneuverability and agility for an additional firing arc, better shielding, increased firepower (see title), and a more expansive upgrade bar. These modifications transform this TIE into a truly unique ship, as it is a small base ship with an auxiliary firing arc, the sensor upgrade, and the tech upgrade. Taking advantage of the combination of the tech and systems upgrade slot is the big perk of ship. Also, the TIE/sf Fighter is one of the few ships whose title is free; this free title is intended to be used on EVERY TIE/sf Fighter, as it grants the ship additional text that would not be possible on the ship cards themselves. The TIE/sf equipped with its mandatory title makes it have an attack of 3 and to be able to fire twice in a round if its attack if not increased. Most of the time, splitting up a ship’s attacks is not that great, because concentrating fire on a target until it is destroyed is usually best practice; however, it is still a fine ability for those instances where it is beneficial to do so. The best use for the TIE/sf is to make maximum use of the auxiliary arc to catch enemies who cannot return fire. With the Segnor’s Loop, the ship can have an arc on an enemy ship quite often. The generic pilots boast higher PS than normal for generic pilots, so the TIE/sf is not a very good blocker. However, it puts those pilots into a position of being better than the opponent’s generic ships, especially the Omega Specialist who has access to an EPT."

	"'Omega Ace'":{"text":"Omega Ace is a fearsome attacker. His ability changes ALL results to critical hits, including blanks. He has a huge target on his head, so the rest of your squad should be more fearsome so the opponent is tempted to leave 'Omega Ace' alone.","rating":2},
	"'Omega Leader'":{"text":"Omega Leader is Dark Curse's bigger, badder younger brother. When facing an enemy ship one on one, Omega Leader almost always wins the exchange. As with Omega Ace, try and have the rest of your squad be more threatening than him.","rating":2},
	"'Epsilon Leader'":{"text":"Epsilon Leader is the ultimate wingman. He performs best when brought into a swarm for TIE Fighters, allowing them to perform stressful maneuvers with more freedom.","rating":2},
	"'Epsilon Ace'":{"text":"Epsilon Ace is a solid alternative to the identically priced Omega Squadron Pilot. He can serve a swarm well as a cheap flanker. He is usually best without any upgrades, as he is purposely inexpensive.","rating":2},
	"'Zeta Ace'":{"text":"Zeta Ace boasts an exceptional maneuvering ability with her barrel roll action. She is very effective as a blocker, and late-game arc dodger. She can perform some very impressive maneuvers with a Segnor's loop, followed by a 2-speed turn, followed by a barrel roll.","rating":2},
	"'Deathrain'":{"text":"Deathrain redefines what it means to be a bomber. His ability is fantastic and frightening on the table. Don’t forget that even if your bomb will not hit anything, you can still drop one to get the barrel roll action.","rating":2},
	"'Redline'":{"text":"Redline makes ordnance weapons much more potent. Keeping the Target Lock for modifying dice for the ordnance launch makes firing those weapons truly fearsome.","rating":1},
	"Commander Kenkirk":{"text":"Kenkirk is a defensive pilot. Outfit him with offensive weaponry so that the opponent wants to focus fire on him.","rating":1},
	"Rear Admiral Chiraneau":{"text":"Chirpy is the most commonly played Decimator, due to his straightforward damage output and high PS. Chirpy prefers the TL action over focus.","rating":2},
	"Captain Oicunn":{"text":"Oicunn loves to ram into enemy formations, especially with the Dauntless title. He is the most aggressive of the Decimator pilots.","rating":1},
	"'Echo'":{"text":"Echo is a fantastic pilot. Her decloaking ability allows her to maintain her firing arc on the enemy while dodging their arc.","rating":3},
	"'Whisper'":{"text":"Whisper's ability performs better against her most hated foe, the PWT, as the focus token can be used for defense with her high agility (due to her ACD cloak). She is a very strong pilot, when piloted well.","rating":2},
	"Countess Ryad":{"text":"Countess Ryad is the most maneuverable of the TIE Defender pilots. She is also the only pilot in the game currently to have FIVE GREEN K-Turns. The versatility of her maneuverability makes her a very strong pilot.","rating":2},
	"Colonel Vessery":{"text":"Colonel Vessery is a very good TIE Defender pilot. If your squad has another ship or two that naturally acquires target locks, Vessery can prove quite capable.","rating":2},
	"Maarek Stele (TIE Defender)":{"text":"Maarek Stele is an interesting pilot, as his ability is not very overwhelming, but he is well costed for his pilot skill. He can be a solid choice, but it can be difficult to effectively utilize his ability without sacrificing his firepower.","rating":1},
	"Captain Yorr":{"text":"Captain Yorr seems to be an underwhelming pilot, but he is very useful at keeping ships vulnerable to stress, stress-free.","rating":1},
	"Rexler Brath":{"text":"Rexler Brath is often chosen mostly due to his PS over his ability. It is difficult to make his effect consistent, but when it works, it can be absolutely devestating.","rating":1},
	"Colonel Jendon":{"text":"Jendon is not a very commonly used pilot, but he has a place in an ordnance-heavy squad.","rating":1},
	"Captain Kagi":{"text":"Kagi is an underperforming ship. He is a pilot who is a silver bullet against TL heavy lists especially when equipped with sensor jammer. He works well with other ships who deny the benefits of focus (such as Carnor Jax).","rating":1},
	"Krassis Trelix":{"text":"Krassis is arguably the strongest Imperial named Firespray pilot. His power comes from repeatedly using a canon upgrade. Try and fly Krassis in such a manner so that he dodges as much fire as possible and survives late into the game.","rating":3},
	"Kath Scarlet":{"text":"Kath is an average pilot. Her ability is fine, but it is a little underpowered. There are upgrades to make use of her ability though.","rating":1},
	"Boba Fett":{"text":"While often underappreciated, Boba can be an effective elite arc dodging pilot. With Navigator, Fett becomes Fettigator and can do any bank maneuver after revealing his dial. (Outmaneuver works out of his auxiliary arc)","rating":2},
	"'Deathfire'":{"text":"Deathfire is an excellent pilot for deploying mines. He is a very cheap platform for mine deployment, and he can threaten much more expensive ships, especially aces.","rating":1},
	"Captain Jonus":{"text":"His ability works best when paired with a bunch of other munitions carriers flying in formation.","rating":1},
	"Major Rhymer":{"text":"Major Rhymer provides much more utility to munitions. Unlike Jonus, Rhymer does not need other bombers to shine. Just make sure that he stays alive long enough to fire all of his munitions.","rating":1},
	"Tomax Bren":{"text":"Tomax Bren is a versatile powerhouse. His ability allows for a variety of build types depending on which EPT upgrade card he uses. While Crack Shot is the most popular EPT for Tomax Bren, it is definitely not the only option.","rating":2},
	"Lieutenant Colzet":{"text":"Colzet is not lighting the world on fire, but he can be a good choice instead of a Storm Squadron Pilot. He is an end game pilot, so the rest of your squad should be equipped to be more threatening than he is.","rating":1},
	"Commander Alozen":{"text":"Alozen, as a midling PS pilot has a hard time equipping the correct EPT for the situation. His ability contradicts the TIE advanced desire to sit at range 3 as much as possible. There are a wide variety of upgrades that can make him more effective, but nothing fits him perfectly.","rating":1},
	"Zertik Strom":{"text":"Strom is a deceptively powerful pilot. He is best utilized as a flanking ship in conjunction with a jousting component of your squad. When the Jousting portion of your list gets within range one of the enemy, Strom can swoop in and make the range 1 exchange very one sided.","rating":2},
	"Maarek Stele (TIE Advanced)":{"text":"Maarek Stele is an elite pilot whose pilot ability perfectly lends itself to the ATC. Use him as the ace of your squad and try and target ships that would suffer the most from critical damage.","rating":2},
	"Juno Eclipse":{"text":"Juno pushes the physical limitations of her TIE Advanced and can perform maneuvers that do not even appear on her maneuver dial. Because of this, she becomes an excellent knife fighter and reactionary arc dodger.","rating":2},
	"Darth Vader":{"text":"The Dark Lord himself, Darth Vader has one of the best pilot abilities in the game. He is a fearsome and adaptable pilot and usually requires the attention of the entire enemy squad to defeat.","rating":3},
	"'Fel's Wrath'":{"text":"Fel's Wrath is a poor pilot. His ability is lackluster, and his lack of an EPT stunts his potential. He is not recommended.","rating":0},
	"Lieutenant Lorrir":{"text":"Lorrir’s ability is better than Fel’s Wrath’s, but his lack of an EPT renders him ineffective. He just doesn’t have the tricks needed to keep his points investment worth it.","rating":0},
	"Kir Kanos":{"text":"Kir Kanos is the best of the named TIE Interceptors with no EPT so far though. His ability actually hits harder than a focus action. The trick is to make Kanos the least desirable target of your squad, so the opponent ignores him. He is definitely a playable pilot, but there are often better options available.","rating":1},
	"Tetran Cowall":{"text":"Tetran is an interesting pilot. Being able to pick the optimal K-Turn is a useful ability, and he is the only ship in the game that can do a 1 speed K-Turn. The issue is that most of the time, Interceptors would rather just do a hard turn and then boost/barrel roll to turn around. At least he has an EPT.","rating":1},
	"Turr Phennir":{"text":" Turr's ability allows him to shoot a lower PS enemy and then immediately boost or barrel roll out of the defender's arc, so Turr does not get shot by return fire. It's important to remember that if you do a barrel roll or boost action during the Activation Phase, he won't be able to do that same action during the Combat Phase.","rating":2},
	"Carnor Jax":{"text":"While the TIE Interceptor is lacking a bit in the middle PS range, they excel at the top. Carnor Jax is a vicious TIE to play against. He excels at range 1, and can ruin entire lists that are action dependent.","rating":2},
	"Soontir Fel":{"text":"The Baron Fel himself, Soontir is a fearsome pilot. As of the few PS 9 pilots in the game, his ace status does not disappoint. When people think of arc dodging ships, Soontir is usually regarded as the best one. Remember that Fel basically has a 3 point Push the Limit tax, as not putting it on him is foolhardy.","rating":3},
	"'Chaser'":{"text":"An alternative to a Black Squadron Pilot, Chaser sacrifices PS and an EPT for an ability. His ability is best utilized when other ships around him have higher PS (so they spend their focus token before Chaser would), OR if a nearby ship is a better target than Chaser.","rating":1},
	"'Wampa'":{"text":"Wampa is another alternative to Black Squadron Pilot, and he is a strong choice. While it is difficult to modify his dice to achieve the desired critical hit result, just by himself, his ability is strong enough to warrant play, punching through highly defensive ships. Wampa paints a target on himself when playing against high agility aces, so the rest of your squad should compensate for this.","rating":2},
	"'Night Beast'":{"text":"Night Beast is a competent TIE pilot. He does fine working his way into swarm lists as a flanker or as a way to fill points in a squad. Getting a free focus allows him to choose a different action as well.","rating":1},
	"'Winged Gundark'":{"text":"Winged Gundark is a poor pilot. He can gain some utility against low agility targets with low shields, but usually there is a better way to spend the points (like on Night Beast).","rating":1},
	"'Backstabber'":{"text":"Backstabber is a solid TIE pilot. He is best used as a flanker for your squad, as he gains an additional attack die for avoiding enemy firing arcs. His only downside is his lack of an EPT.","rating":2},
	"'Dark Curse'":	{"text":"Dark Curse is a fearsome and elusive TIE Fighter pilot. He works well as a flanker or as a complement to a small strike force of different ships. His ability usually dissuades the opponent from even targeting him, so he often lasts into the late game.","rating":3},
	"'Youngster'":{"text":"While Youngster’s ability may seem strong, the lack of powerful Action EPTs hampers his usefulness. If more powerful Action EPTs come out, Youngster may see his time to shine.","rating":1},
	"'Mauler Mithel'":{"text":"Mithel is a good pilot. He is effective at fighting toe-to-toe with more expensive ships, as his attack is boosted at range one. He is at his best when he is outside of enemy arcs, as being in range 1 greatly decreases his life span.","rating":2},
	"'Scourge'":{"text":"Scourge is a strong pilot that compensates well for the TIE Fighter’s low attack stat. He pairs well with cards that inflict damage cards such as Wampa, Advanced Homing Missiles, and Proton Bombs.","rating":2},
	"'Howlrunner'":{"text":"Howlrunner is the most popular and effective named TIE pilot. She is very good at leading a swarm for 6-7 TIEs in tight formation as her ability will trigger on all of them. Since she is a desirable target, sometimes it is best to use her evade action even when she has a shot, just to help protect her a little more. Her upgrades should be defensive in nature.","rating":3}
    },
    "upgrades": {
	"BoShek(Crew)":{"text":"When a ship you are touching activates, you may look at its chosen maneuver. If you do, its owner must rotate the dial to an adjacent maneuver. The ship can reveal and execute that maneuver even while stressed."},
	"Bistan(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Bistan is a Rebel version of Mercenary Copilot (crew). Mercenary Copilot is not very good, and Bistan is slightly better, but coming in at two points and taking up the valuable crew slot makes him a hard sell."},
	"Expertise":{"rating":2,"text":"Expertise is a powerful upgrade. While expensive, it offers exceptional dice modding to a ship's attack rolls as long as it is unstressed. A ship equipped with Expertise needs to want to consistently take an action other than focus in order for this upgrade to be worth its points, as well as being a ship that is rarely stressed. Expertise combos well with Advanced Proton Torpedoes. Expertise also works really with ships that can attack multiple times, such as TIE Defenders equipped with the TIE/D title."},
	"Lightweight Frame":{"rating":2,"text":"Lightweight Frame is an effective way to boost the survivability of TIE’s with agility lower than 3. The best uses for this card are on TIE Punishers, TIE Strikers, TIE Bombers (with the TIE Shuttle upgrade), and TIE/sf Fighters. The only real problem with this upgrade is that it sometimes competes with other modifications."},
	"Swarm Leader":{"rating":2,"text":"Swarm Leader offers an added punch to swarm squads that have a hard time punching through ships with heavy evade defenses. The more ships in the swarm, the better, and they need to have the evade action to make use of the EPT. While it does have a few restrictions, being able to increase an attack value by 2 can be extremely powerful. The trick is to make sure that the ships that spend their evade tokens need to be facing the enemy the ship with Swarm Leader."},
	"Adaptive Ailerons":{"rating":3,"text":"This is the title for the TIE Striker. While it is not technically an auto-include due its downside, its advantages almost always outweigh its disadvantages. This title grants unprecedented maneuverability and the ability to adjust the TIE Striker’s heading on the fly. A potent strategy with this upgrade is to include upgrades that cause self-stress at will, so that the extra speed that this title provides can be shut off when needed. Push the Limit (EPT) works well for this."},
	"Inspiring Recruit(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Inspiring Recruit is a great support crew. It is very useful for squads that use self-stressing upgrades, as well when enemy squads inflict stress. Inspiring Recruit works really well with Rage (EPT), and works well on support ships such as the HWK-290, Lambda-Class Shuttle, and U-wing."},
	"Bodhi Rook(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Bodhi is a situationally useful upgrade for lower PS ships that want to be able to acquire target locks for munitions, but otherwise would have a hard time doing so. Bodhi’s main issue is that he is a crew, which means that his mediocre ability has a huge opportunity cost of not running another crew card. He can be used effectively in a few specific squads though."},
	"Baze Malbus(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Baze Malbus is a budget Gunner (crew). He comes in at two fewer squad points, but his second attack cannot attack the same ship as the first attack. This makes him much less effective than Gunner, and necessitates his use on a turret ship. He is usable, but if able, pay the extra two points for Gunner, or four more points for Luke Skywalker (crew), as splitting fire across multiple ships is not a typically game-winning strategy."},
	"Pivot Wing":{"rating":3,"text":"Pivot Wing is an essential upgrade for U-wings. It allows the ship to have the option to reduce its agility to enable its ability to perform a 0-speed K-turn. There is no reason this card should ever be omitted from a U-wing."},
	"Pivot Wing (Attack)":{"text":"Increase your agility value by 1. After you execute a maneuver, you may flip this card."},
	"Pivot Wing (Landing)":{"text":"When you reveal a [%STOP% 0] maneuver, you may rotate your ship 180°. After you execute a maneuver, you may flip this card."},
	"Spacetug Tractor Array":{"text":"%ACTION% Choose a ship inside your firing arc at Range 1 and assign a tractor beam token to it. If it is a friendly ship, resolve the effect of the tractor beam token as though it were an enemy ship."},
	"Scavenger Crane":{"text":"After a ship at Range 1-2 is destroyed, you may choose a discarded %TORPEDO%, %MISSILE%, %BOMB%, %CANNON%, %TURRET% or %MOD% Upgrade card that was equipped to your ship and flip it faceup. Then roll 1 attack die. On a blank result, discard Scavenger Crane. "},
	"Captured TIE":{"text":"Enemy ships with a pilot skill value lower than yours cannot declare you as the target of an attack. After you perform an attack, or when you are the only remaining friendly ship in play, discard this card."},
	"EMP Device":{"text":"During the Combat phase, instead of performing any attack,  you may discard this card to assign 2 ion tokens to each ship at Range 1."},
	"Captain Rex(Crew)":{"text":"After you perform an attack that does not hit, you may assign 1 focus token to your ship."},
	"Cassian Andor(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Cassian Andor is a strong upgrade. He is very useful for blocking ships OR for ships that do not want to be blocked. He is a skill-testing upgrade, but the key to using him is to narrow down the opponent’s maneuvers into two different likely options. Prepare for one of them, and then allow your guess with Cassian Andor to allow you to adjust for the other one."},
	"A Score To Settle":{"text":"During setup, before the 'Place Forces' step, select 1 enemy ship and assign the 'A Debt To Pay' Condition card to it. When attacking a ship that has the 'A Debt To Pay' Condition card, you may change 1 %FOCUS% result to a %CRIT% hit result. "},
	"General Hux(Crew)":{"text":"%ACTION% Choose up to 3 friendly ships at Range 1-2. Assign 1 focus token to each of those ships and assign the 'Fanatical Devotion' Condition card to 1 of them. Then receive 1 stress token."},
	"Kylo Ren(Crew)":{"text":"%ACTION% Assign the 'I'll Show You the Dark Side' Condition card to an enemy ship at Range 1-3."},
	"Operations Specialist(Crew)":{"text":"After a friendly ship at Range 1-2 performs an attack that does not hit, you may assign 1 focus token to a friendly ship at Range 1-3 of the attacker."},
	"Kylo Ren's Shuttle":{"text":"At the end of the Combat phase, choose an unstressed enemy ship at Range 1-2. Its owner must assign a stress token to it or assign a stress token to another ship at Range 1-2 of you that that player controls."},
	"Targeting Synchronizer":{"text":"When a friendly ship at Range 1-2 is attacking a ship you have locked, the friendly ship treats the 'Attack (target lock):' header as 'Attack:'. If a game effect instructs that ship to spend a target lock, it may spend your target lock instead."},
	"Hyperwave Comm Scanner":{"text":"At the start of the 'Place forces' step, you may choose to treat your pilot skill value as '0', '6' or '12' until the end of the step. During setup, after another friendly ship is placed at Range 1-2, you may assign 1 focus or evade token to it."},
	"Pattern Analyzer":{"rating":2,"text":"Pattern Analyzer is similar to Advanced Sensors (Systems) in that it provides a way to take actions while performing red maneuvers. Being able to take an action before K-Turning is strong and is definitely worth two points. This upgrade tends to be better on high PS ships that need to maximize their efficiency during red maneuvers."},
	"M9-G8":{"rating":2,"text":"M9-G8 is a strong upgrade for ships that do not have much of a desire to use rerolls and/or target locks. The versatility of using the target lock on an allied ship to augment their attack early in the game and being able to switch the target to another allied ship or an enemy ship is really strong. It is a little pricy, but if you can spare the points, it is a universally strong upgrade."},
	"Trick Shot":{"rating":3,"text":"Trick Shot is extremely powerful, mostly due to the fact that it is a free upgrade. Since attack dice are stronger than defense dice AND that increasing the dice count of an attack increases the variance of damage, this upgrade is deceptively powerful. Adaptability is the only other EPT that is zero points, so use Trick Shot when PS is not very important to your list/squad, and use Adaptability when an adjustment of PS is important for your squad composition. Trick Shot is more effective on turret ships as they can exploit obstacles more effectively."},
	"Snap Shot":{"rating":2,"text":"Snap Shot is a very strong upgrade for mid-tier PS ships that move before high PS aces. Snap Shot triggers before the enemy ship can take an action, so Snap Shot is a way to get free damage on enemy ships. Also, it creates a “No-Fly-Zone” in range one for ships that cannot afford to take the risk of being damaged. While you cannot modify your attack with Snap Shot, you can add attack dice with effects or effect the opponent’s defense with effects like Juke (EPT), Jan Ors (HWK-290), or even effects like Ten Numb (B-wing). Snap Shot IS considered a secondary weapon and it works even better in multiples."},
	"Primed Thrusters":{"rating":1,"text":"Primed Thrusters is strong for ships that have good dice modifications that are action-less, gets stressed, AND has the boost and/or barrel roll actions. This naturally restricts the card a little, but for only 1 point, being able to do repositioning actions while being stressed is always going to be good."},
	"Black One":{"rating":1,"text":"Black One is a niche upgrade. Because it is not always a relevant against squads that do not card about target locks, Black One should only be included in a squad if you have a free point for its inclusion. Black One works better with BB-8 (Astromech) due to granting the barrel roll action, and it allows Black One to be triggered twice in a turn."},
	"Rey(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Rey is like a soft Moldy Crow title. Rey offers her ship the ability to always have a focus token when it needs it. This can add additional resiliency to a ship with higher agility and can help augment the ship after performing a stressful maneuver. Also, Rey can act kind of like a Push the Limit (EPT), as it frees up your action to be something other than focus. Any effects that trigger off of focus tokens gets a huge boon from Rey. Rey’s biggest issue is that she is a crew upgrade and she competes with many other upgrade cards for a slot."},
	"Burnout Slam":{"rating":2,"text":"Burnout SLAM grants the SLAM action to large base ships. For only one point, this is a solid upgrade to help the equipped ship get into position for next round OR to escape a bad position if you mis-maneuver. This is well worth its inclusion in a squad, if you can afford not using another illicit upgrade. Also, if you have two of these equipped to the same ship, the second one would discard after the first one is used (so don't equip more than one of these per ship)."},
	"Smuggling Compartment":{"rating":2,"text":"Smuggling Compartment offers some added customizability to the YT-1300 and the YT-2400 and grants the Rebel faction access to illicit upgrades. The big downside, here, is that if you have Smuggling Compartment equipped, Engine Upgrade cannot be equipped. That makes the Smuggling Compartment a little more attractive for lower PS ships."},
	"Finn(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Finn is a deceptive strong card; while it does not fit in very many squads, he works really well with Rey (YT-1300) and other effects that use rerolls and/or target locks. Whenever an effect increases the total attack dice of an attack, even if it is a black result, the effect needs to be looked at. That being said though, outside of Finn’s interaction with Rey, he has a hard time finding a place in a squad."},
	"Millennium Falcon(HoR)":{"rating":2,"text":"The Millennium Falcon title (New Republic Trilogy version) is preferred if you doubt you would ever use the evade action from the other title OR your pilot is Rey. Otherwise, the other title is usually stronger."},
	"Sabine's Masterpiece":{"text":"Your upgrade bar gains the %CREW% and %ILLICIT% upgrade icons."},
	"Jyn Erso(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Jyn Erso is an interesting upgrade card. By sacrificing the equipped ship’s action, another ship in your squad can gain a pile of focus tokens, which is useful if they can make multiple attacks of if they can get attacked multiple times. Jyn is a niche upgrade, that can occasionally find useful application in a squad."},
	"Unkar Plutt(Crew)":{"text":"After executing a maneuver that causes you to overlap an enemy ship, you may suffer 1 damage to perform 1 free actions."},
	"Gyroscopic Targeting":{"rating":2,"text":"Gyroscopic Targeting is a modification unique to the Lancer-Class Pursuit Craft. It allows the mobile firing arc to be corrected for free during the End Phase if the ship is traveling at a high speed. This augments the ship’s pre-existing desire to fly fast and aggressive. If your game-plan calls for precise use of lining up your mobile firing arc, this upgrade deserves strong consideration."},
	"Black Market Slicer Tools":{"rating":3,"text":"Black Market Slicer Tools is a meta-defining card. It counters ships that self-stress, like ships that abuse Push the Limit (EPT). For only one point, sliding one or two of this upgrade into a list is relatively easy, and it creates a no-fly-zone range 2 bubble around the ship for PtL “Aces.” This card is very similar to Feedback Array (Illicit), in that they both are ways to damage an enemy ship without attacking it. Both are strong, as BMST needs them to be stressed, removes the stress, and can fail, while FA costs more, has lower range, self-harms, and sacrifices the ship’s attack. Of the two BMST is better overall, but FA still has a place, as a guaranteed damage can often be better than an intermittent one. Don’t forget to combo BMST with stress-causing upgrades."},
	"IG-88D(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"IG-88D is a crew version of the IG-2000 title for Aggressors. This upgrade allows any ship with a crew upgrade slot available to gain the boost of an Aggressor pilot’s pilot ability. Whenever you fly an Aggressor alongside a different ship, strongly consider using this upgrade."},
	"Rigged Cargo Chute":{"rating":2,"text":"This is a truly unique upgrade. This illicit upgrade drops a debris cloud token onto the battlefield; that token has the same rules as other debris cloud obstacles. The ability to modify the battlefield itself is a rare boon, and this ability should not be underestimated in its ability to alter flight paths and renegotiate engagements. In addition, if this obstacle is dropped on to of an enemy ship that has not moved yet, and has its dial set to a red maneuver, you can choose their maneuver for them (per normal rules for selecting a red maneuver while stressed). Do not underestimate this upgrade."},
	"Ketsu Onyo(Crew)":{"text":"At the start of the End phase, you may choose 1 enemy ship inside your firing arc at Range 1-2. That ship does not remove its tractor beam tokens."},
	"Latts Razzi(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Latts Razzi is a solid upgrade card. She adds resiliency to the ship she is equipped to, as long as the enemy attacking her ship is stressed. She is a trump card to Push the Limit (EPT) equipped ships, as well as comboing really well with stress causing pilots as Asajj Ventress (Lancer-Class Pursuit Craft) or 4-LOM (G-1A Starfighter) or stress causing upgrades such as Flechette Cannon, or Tactician (Crew). She is best in a squad built around inflicting stress on the opponent. Without building around her ability, she will be situationally useful in almost every game she is played."},
	"Fearlessness":{"rating":2,"text":"Fearlessness favors aggressive, head-on approaches with the enemy at close range. Adding and attack die is a HUGE boon, especially for only one point. The downside of course is that you leave your craft exposed to return fire. Jousters that can consistently do fast maneuvers (with many greens) or jousters with boost can benefit a lot from this upgrade. That being said, you need to have a specific plan in place for using this card, as it creates a completely different playstyle for its equipped ship. Fearlessness also combos well with range 1 missiles and torpedoes."},
	"Concord Dawn Protector":{"rating":2,"text":"The Concord Dawn Protector title offers Protectorate Starfighters and alternate option when flying. While Protectorate Starfighters typically behave like arc-dodgers, trying to duck and weave through the battlefield while taking as few enemy shots as possible, this title allows the ship to scream into range one of an enemy ship and be able to shrug off damage more effectively. This title works well against one enemy ship, but when taking fire from multiple sources, even with this title, the Protectorate Starfighter’s resiliency falters. This is a great title to grant the ship the ability to alter tactics on the fly, but this title does not turn the Protectorate Starfighter into an efficient jouster. It just makes it a tolerable option when other options in tactics are not as strong."},
	"Alliance Overhaul":{"rating":3,"text":"Alliance Overhaul is essentially a part of the rules text of all ARC-170s, as there is literally zero reason to not equip this title to an ARC-170. It makes attacks from the front firing arc roll an additional attack die, while granting a different ability to shots firing from the auxiliary arc."},
	"Vectored Thrusters":{"rating":1,"text":"Similar to the Expert Handling (EPT) upgrade, Vectored Thrusters grants a small ship the ability to barrel roll. While not a bad card by any means, it is difficult to find a place for it, as this upgrade is best on ships with the boost action, but without the barrel roll action, like the A-wing. However, ships with the boost action tend to prefer Autothrusters for their modification slot."},
	"Tail Gunner(Crew)":{"rating":3,"text":"Tail Gunner is an excellent upgrade for those few ships that are able to utilize its ability. The Firespray-31 and the ARC-170 are the only ships that gain anything from equipping this upgrade, but it is very powerful on those ships, as it increases their damage output significantly without requiring an action. It also promotes flying those ships with auxiliary firing arcs a little differently than normal, which is good for mixing up the game."},
	"R3 Astromech":{"rating":1,"text":"The R3 Astromech is a unique concept that ultimately fails to deliver. It is only useful on high PS pilots, and it relies on rolling a focus result to function AND it most likely reduces the firepower of the attacker as well, as they can't use that focus token for attacking. Norra Wexly (ARC-170) is okay using this Astromech, but even then, it is not very impressive."},
	"Sensor Cluster":{"rating":2,"text":"While often underappreciated, Sensor Cluster greatly increases a ship's defensive capacity for only two points. Two-agility ships gain the most from this upgrade, while 3+defense ships don't get as much mileage out of it. However, if your squad only has a few ships and you need more ways to augment the surviability of those ships, Sensor Cluster can be a very effective option."},
	"Special Ops Training":{"rating":3,"text":"Special Ops Training is essentially a part of the rules text of all TIE/sf Fighters, as there is literally zero reason to not equip this title to a TIE/sf Fighter. It makes attacks from the front firing arc roll an additional attack die, while granting a different ability to shots firing from the auxiliary arc. It is usually best to try and concentrate fire on one target at a time, instead of splitting up the attacks of a ship, but there are times where the extra attack can prove powerful."},
     "Collision Detector":{"rating":3,"text":"Collision Detector is an amazing upgrade. It allows some versatility to repositioning actions, but it also ignores all critical damage for obstacles (this is true even for normal maneuvers). This card is free, so if a ship does not have another systems upgrade already equipped, the Collision Detector must be included."},
    "Ion Cannon Turret":{"rating":2,"text":"Ion Cannon Turret, while expensive, is a very potent upgrade in a list that is good at capitalizing on the opponent’s maneuvering being crippled by ion tokens. Similar to the Ion Cannon, the Ion Cannon Turret loses effectiveness against large base ships and ships that have repositioning actions, but even then, this upgrade still has value, as a 360 attack grants the equipped ship a lot of versatility."},
    "Proton Torpedoes":{"rating":2,"text":"Proton Torpedoes are the standard for which all other torpedoes are judged. Proton Torpedoes are the baseline torpedo that all other torpedoes are ranked against. Proton Torpedoes work best when fired with the required target lock AND target lock equivalent for dice modification. Combined with Guidance Chips (Modification) and a target lock equivalent, Proton Torpedoes almost always roll 4 hits. These missiles can be fielded with success on any dedicated ordnance carrier. Proton Torpedoes are preferred to Concussion Missiles if the ship firing them has a target lock equivalent for dice modification."},
    "R2 Astromech":{"rating":2,"text":"While not flashy, the R2 Astromech radically improves the maneuver dial of the X-wing and Y-wing ships, which is not to be underestimated. Also, the R2 Astromech tends to be the astromech of choice when comboing an Astromech upgrade with the Integrated Astromech (Modification) upgrade for X-wings."},
    "R2-D2":{"rating":3,"text":"R2-D2 is the baseline when it comes to regenerating effects for the Rebels. While R2-D2 cannot be equipped to any ship, entire squads can be built around the regenerating ability of R2-D2. Pilots like Biggs Darklighter (T-65 X-wing), Corran Horn (E-wing), and Poe Dameron (T-70 X-wing) to name a few can be built with R2-D2’s powerful regenerating effects in mind. Regeneration is very effecting against low dice attacks, but tend to fail under heavy attacks such as those from munitions."},
    "R2-F2":{"rating":1,"text":"R2-F2 is a very fringe upgrade card that has only ever found any considerable usefulness on Biggs Darklighter (T-65 X-wing), where the increase in agility can be maximized to considerable effect. Even then, there are still plenty of other options for Astromech Droids on Biggs that R2-F2 is rarely used. Other than for Biggs, R2-F2 is terribly inefficient for three points, and should not be played at any other time. R2-F2 barely gets the rating of one for its occasional usefulness on Biggs."},
    "R5-D8":{"rating":1,"text":"R5-D8 is a very poor card with few practical uses. It requires an action, costs three points, has a chance to fail, and only works when on facedown damage cards. There are a few fringe cases for this card on some of the ARC-170s, but even then this card has many downsides."},
    "R5-K6":{"rating":0,"text":"R5-K6 is trash. It is a strictly worse Fire-Control System (Systems) upgrade. The fact that it has a 3/8 success rate makes the upgrade unplayable."},
    "R5 Astromech":{"rating":1,"text":"A very niche upgrade, R5 Astromech is only really worth its points on either class of X-wing when combined with Integrated Astromech (Modification). However, R2 Astromech is usually a stronger choice. If R2 Astromech is not a good choice though, R5 Astromech is a decent substitution and does deserve some play sometimes to help reduce the effectiveness of critical damage."},
    "Determination":{"rating":1,"text":"Determination is best with cards that combo with it. 'Leebo' (YT-2400) is a great example of this. 'Leebo's' ability allows some choice when selecting suffered critical damage, and Determination can just discard it if it is has the Pilot trait. Other than this specific instance though, Determination is not worth the opportunity cost of another upgrade."},
    "Swarm Tactics":{"rating":1,"text":"While not the most amazing upgrade, in a swarm build, Swarm Tactics can be used to elevate the PS of multiple low PS ships so that they all fire early in the combat phase. Swarm Tactics combos from one ship to another if multiple Swarm Tactics are in the same squad, and it is effective to chain multiple ships together with Swarm Tactics. This tactic is rather niche and has fallen out of favor recently, but it can still be effective."},
    "Squad Leader":{"rating":1,"text":"Squad Leader tends to suffer a bit from the fact that your actions on higher PS ships tend to be much more critical than lower PS ships. Therefore, the ability to pass an action onto a lower PS ship is not very attractive. There are places where it can be useful, but a better EPT can usually be found for a similar price point."},
    "Expert Handling":{"rating":1,"text":"Expert Handling is sometimes useful on a large base ship that also has access to the boost action in order to increase its positioning ability. Expert Handling also has the added benefit of removing TLs from the ship which is relevant. There is nothing wrong with Expert Handling, but usually ships need more firepower than positioning, so sometimes Expert Handing is ignored as a viable option, but it has its place."},
    "Marksmanship":{"rating":1,"text":"Marksmanship is a little over-costed for what it brings to the table. It is really only worth its cost when a ship it is equipped to can attack multiple times a round, as Marksmanship applies to all of those attacks, unlike a focus token, which Marksmanship is directly compared to. Without attacking multiple times a round, Marksmanship is just a three point focus action that is slightly better when attacking and unusable when defending, which is not very useful. Pilots like Corran Horn (E-wing) or TIE/D titled TIE Defenders may consider this upgrade. For only one more point, a ship can equip Expertise (EPT), which is an overall stronger upgrade."},
    "Concussion Missiles":{"rating":2,"text":"Concussion Missiles are the baseline missile that all other missiles are ranked against. Concussion Missiles work best when fired with the required target lock AND focus for dice modification. Combined with Guidance Chips (Modification) and a focus token, Concussion Missiles almost always roll 4 hits. These missiles can be fielded with success on any dedicated ordnance carrier. Concussion Missiles are preferred to Proton Torpedoes if the ship firing them has a focus token for dice modification."},
    "Cluster Missiles":{"rating":1,"text":"In order for Cluster Missiles to be worth their cost, there need to be modifications on the dice rolls for EACH attack. Also, Cluster Missiles can only fire at ranges 1-2, which make them a little less strong than those missiles that can hit enemies at ranges 2-3. While Cluster Missiles can shred low agility targets, they tend to struggle a bit against high agility targets. A natural fit for Cluster Missiles is N’Dru Suhlak with Lone Wolf (EPT), Glitterstim (Illicit), and Guidance Chips (Modification)."},
    "Daredevil":{"rating":1,"text":"This is a very niche upgrade, but it does have some uses. Basically it is a boost that uses the 1-turn template. This is situationally very good, if the downsides can be mitigated. There is one pilot who uses this card very well, and his name is Tycho Celchu (A-wing). Tycho almost completely ignores the down sides of stress, and he can equip another EPT due to A-Wing Test Pilot (Title). Other than Tycho, Daredevil is usually best avoided."},
    "Elusiveness":{"rating":1,"text":"Elusiveness is one of the few defensive EPTs in the game. It triggers before the opponent gets a chance to reroll, so the rerolled die from Elusiveness cannot be rerolled again by the opponent. Use Elusiveness if a member of your squad is vital to keep alive. Otherwise, the general effectiveness of Elusiveness is not that great, but since defensive upgrades are hard to come by, this card has its uses in some specific situations, like on a 'Howlrunner' (TIE Fighter) in a TIE swarm or on Ezra Bridger (Attack Shuttle)."},
    "Homing Missiles":{"rating":3,"text":"Homing Missiles are the most well regarded and popular missile upgrade. While expensive, coming in a point more than the standard Concussion Missile, Homing Missiles compensate for this by not having to discard the target lock to attack and by ignoring evade tokens during the attack. These factors combine to make a missile that hits extremely hard against agile “Ace” type ships. Homing Missiles combo well with Long-Range Scanners, as then the attacker can use target lock plus focus on the attack."},
    "Push the Limit":{"rating":3, "text":"Push the Limit is the staple EPT for assisting a ship with action economy. All other action economy effects are usually compared directly to Push the Limit. The versatility of this upgrade cannot be understated. The ability to do two actions a turn is invaluable. This is especially true for ships that have repositioning actions on their action bar, such as barrel roll and boost. Push the Limit allows ships to use both repositioning actions (if available), or to reposition once without harming their dice modifying ability (with focus, target lock, and/or evade). Pushing the Limit can also ignore repositioning and just stack dice modification actions for a huge spike in efficiency. That being said, Push the Limit’s downside of putting a stress on the ship means that ships without a lot of green maneuvers should steer clear of this upgrade most of the time. And using Push the Limit makes your next maneuver more predictable, which is very relevant."},
    "Deadeye":{"rating":2,"text":"Deadeye is very effective at allowing lower PS ships with EPTs (like A-wings) fire ordnance. This upgrade needs to be combined with torpedoes or missiles and Guidance Chips (Modification) for it to function."},
    "Expose":{"rating":0,"text":"Expose is trash. It costs FOUR points, requires an action, adding an attack die is worse than a focus action (not completely worse, as it does increase the highest amount of damage possible, but the average damage output is worse for Expose than a focus action), AND it reduces your agility by 1. Bleh. There are some fringe cases where you can maybe justify it on a ship with 0 agility, but Expose still costs a whopping four points."},
    "Gunner(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Gunner is a very popular card for primary weapon turret ships, as these ships tend to be very expensive and therefore do not get a lot of opportunities to attack during a game. Therefore, these ships want to get some damage through, and that is exactly what Gunner does. Sometimes, players will choose to not spend tokens on defense and take 1 damage to prevent Gunner from triggering. Gunner is very strong for this reason and can really help punch through targets with a lot of defense tokens."},
    "Ion Cannon":{"rating":2,"text":"An underappreciated card, Ion Cannon trades the ability to do more than one damage per attack to inflict a potentially crippling ion token on the target. While more powerful than the Flechette Cannon, the Ion Cannon does have a few drawbacks, as ion tokens do not affect large base ships as much as small base ships, and that Ion Cannon’s reduced damage output can prove to be a hindrance sometimes. However, the amount of control that this card brings to a ship/squad, should not be underestimated, and opponents will often play quite differently if they see you sporting an Ion Cannon. The Ion Cannon is a natural fit on TIE/D titled TIE Defenders."},
    "Heavy Laser Cannon":{"rating":2,"text":"The Heavy Laser Cannon trades the chance to do critical damage for increased total damage output. While this cannon is expensive, it is often well-worth its cost, as being able to unleash four attack dice at ranges 2-3 (and ignoring range 3 bonuses), is a massive boon. While the card has fallen in popularity recently, that does not reduce the strength of the card, as any card that can permanently increase the attack stat of a ship should not be ignored. The Heavy Laser Cannon is preferred on ships that have fewer than 3 attack, as those ships gain more from the four dice offered by Heavy Laser Cannon. Lastly, HLC is best in squads with few ships, as these lists need the additional firepower that this cannon brings."},
    "Seismic Charges":{"rating":1,"text":"Seismic Charges are the generic bomb. They are not flashy by any means, but they can slide their way into squads due to their utility and cheap cost. Like most bombs, they will radically change how your opponent flies, which is part of the benefit of using bombs in the first place."},
    "Mercenary Copilot(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Mercenary Copilot is a very fringe upgrade. He is only useful on ships that gain extra power from critical hits, like Bossk (YV-666), and even then, Mercenary Copilot only grants that critical hit at range 3. For the most part this upgrade card is not very effective, but there are a few cases where he is not terrible. Mercenary Copilot is very similar to Bistan (crew), but has a different range band where it is effective."},
    "Assault Missiles":{"rating":1,"text":
    "Assault Missiles hit hard and are particularly punishing to enemy lists with lots of ships of low cost. The damage an Assault Missile can deal can be quite substantial... or it can be minimal, depending on the opponent’s squad composition. Because of this high variance, Assault Missiles are a little too inconsistent to be included in most squads. Also, the Assault Missiles can damage your own ships too, if you are not careful about that. Lt. Blount (Z-95 Headhunter) is a good candidate for Assault Missiles."},
    "Veteran Instincts":{"rating":3,"text":
    "Veteran Instincts is a deceptively powerful upgrade. It is most useful on “Ace” type ships that favor repositioning actions so that they can see the state of the rest of the board before making their repositioning decisions. There are also multiple effects that work better at higher PS, such as Advanced Cloaking Device (Modification) and Tractor Beam (Cannon). Veteran Instincts is more of an insurance upgrade. Sometimes it will have no effect on the game, but other times it can guarantee that your ace is better than the opponent’s ace."},
    "Proximity Mines":{"rating":2,"text":"Proximity mines are a potent force, as they are a solid option at dealing damage directly past defense dice. Unfortunately, Proximity Mines have a chance of failing completely, which keeps them out of competitive play a lot, but it would be foolish to underestimate the strength of these mines, as their failure rate is not extremely common."},
    "Weapons Engineer(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Weapons Engineer is a niche upgrade. This upgrade is best on ships that get big boons from having extra target locks, such as Latts Razzi. Without an effect that specifically gains a huge boost from having extra target locks, Weapons Engineer is too expensive to use most of the time."},
    "Draw Their Fire":{"rating":1,"text":"A fringe upgrade, Draw Their Fire is occasionally useful to help protect a critical member or your squad. For example, a Black Squadron Pilot (TIE Fighter) could run Draw Their Fire to help protect 'Howlrunner' (TIE Fighter). You need a very specific reason to run this upgrade, as there are so many other great EPTs that are available for 1 point."},
    "Luke Skywalker(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Luke is a Gunner (Crew) that hits a little harder. Luke is a little overpriced, but if your squad would play Gunner and you have a few points to spare, Luke is a fine inclusion in your list. For the most part, though, Gunner is a better way to spend your points."},
    "Nien Nunb(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Nien Numb is a mediocre crew card. He is best when paired with ships that gain extra advantages from green maneuvers, like Lando Calrissian (YT-1300). Other than a few specific instances, Nien Numb is not very potent."},
    "Chewbacca(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Crewbacca, as he is sometimes called, is a strictly better Shield Upgrade (Modification). He is usually best on ships that need a little help improving their resiliency, but also have high agility. Because he is a crew card, it can be difficult to find a place for him on a ship, as he is also a little expensive. However, he is often sighted on Attack Shuttles and HWK-290s. His ability can also trigger whenever you take a damage card (including critical hits) from things other than attacks, further increasing his usefulness."},
    "Advanced Proton Torpedoes":{"rating":1,"text":
    "Advanced Proton Torpedoes are extremely expensive. Even for its massive attack stat, it still requires the target to be at range 1 and for the attacker to have a focus token too in order to take full advantage of the torpedo. The only thing keeping this upgrade from the unplayable category is that there are fringe ways to subvert the downsides of this card, such as Major Rhymer’s effect (TIE Bomber)."},
    "Autoblaster":{"rating":0,"text":"Autoblaster has a very powerful effect that is incredibly effective against high agility, “Ace” type ships that rely on their agility dice and token stacking for their defense. Autoblaster proves a way to punch through that defense. Unfortunately, Autoblaster is grossly overcosted and never deserves to see play because of it. Even if a squad can afford to play it, the fact that the attack is limited to range 1 only, and it is not very useful in certain match-ups makes the card unplayable."},
    "Fire-Control System":{"rating":1,"text":"Fire-Control System is a very action efficient upgrade. Remember that upgrades that modify dice should always be considered, and Fire-Control System is a strong one. Even though the Target Lock gained by Fire-Control System cannot be used during the attack it was gained from, it sets up all following attacks on that ship to have that modification present. Use Fire-Control System to just amp up a ship’s attack or to help continue firing ordnance at the target (missiles and torpedoes). Fire-Control System does struggle against enemy squads that have many enemy ships, as it can be difficult to keep the desired target in sight from round to round."},
    "Blaster Turret":{"rating":1,"text":"Blaster Turret is a niche turret upgrade. Its cost is a little high, and the requirement to spend a focus to attack greatly reduces the strength of attacks from this card. In addition, if a ship carrying this upgrade gets blocked, they cannot even use the turret. These factors all combine to make a rather unattractive turret card. For the most part, Dorsal Turret is usually the better option. However, the Blaster Turret has a home on Moldy Crow titled HWK-290s, as the downsides regarding focus tokens are almost completely mitigated, and then Blaster Turret becomes worth its points."},
    "Recon Specialist(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Recon Specialist is an all-around good card that isn’t lighting the world on fire, but it pops up in solid lists here and there. It is good at creating a consistent increase in the efficiency of a ship. HWK-290s with their Moldy Crow title love Recon Specialist, and some ships just gravitate towards the consistency of Recon Specialist, such as the Firespray-31. The main problem with Recon Specialist is that is not very flashy, but it definitely deserves consideration in a squad."},
    "Saboteur(Crew)":{"rating":0,"text":"Saboteur is the worst upgrade in the game. He is awful and should never be played. Costing two points, requiring an action, requiring the ship to have a facedown damage card, requiring the enemy ship to be at range 1, and then only working 50% of the time is deplorable."},
    "Agent Kallus(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Agent Kallus is interesting in that he is both strong in lists that have only a few ships, and he is strong against lists that only have a few ships. Agent Kallus is best when on a ship that either gets attacked a lot during a round or if it does not often utilize focus tokens, or if you want to be able to more freely use repositioning, target lock, or evade actions. Because of all of those factors, it can be hard to utilize him effectively, but he definitely can find a home in a few places, such as on board a TIE Phantom."},
    "Intelligence Agent(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Intelligence Agent has a few uses. The most common use is to utilize it on a decloaking TIE Phantom, as knowing where an enemy ship will be can make your choice of where to decloak to much better. Another use is on lot PS ships that have repositioning actions that like to bump enemy ships, as you will be able to see where the enemy ship will be before you reposition yourself in the way. Other than those two uses, Intelligence Agent does not do too much for most ships. Intelligence Agent is also good when combed with Navigator(Crew)."},
    "Proton Bombs":{"rating":1,"text":"Proton Bombs are absolutely terrifying. Being able to inflict critical damage directly through the shields is a huge deal. Sometimes this card can destroy or cripple an enemy ship without the enemy ship being able to do a thing about it. The very high cost of Proton Bombs keeps them out of lists sometimes, but Extra Munitions (Torpedo) can help mitigate that downside quite a bit."},
    "Adrenaline Rush":{"rating":1,"text":"Adrenaline Rush is a niche upgrade. It is definitely useful, but the EPT is a precious slot, and often there can be a better way to spend that point, like Crack Shot (EPT). That does not mean to say that this card is bad. When used effectively, a red maneuver turning into a white one can completely swing a game. Consider this card on ships that don’t like to be stressed, but have a decent number of red maneuvers. It also is a worthy choice on a TIE Shuttle Tomax Bren (TIE Bomber)"},
    "Advanced Sensors":{"rating":2,"text":"Although this upgrade has fallen from favor in recent history, nonetheless it is still a formidable upgrade card. Being able to use a reposition action before maneuvering is HUGE. Also, this effect allows the ship to take an action before doing a stressful maneuver, which would normally prevent an action. In addition to stress, Advanced Sensors gets around the loss of an action due to bumping another ship or hitting an obstacle. This upgrade is great for higher PS ships that want to avoid the loss of action due to getting blocked. Advanced Sensors is a very versatile upgrade that can also combo well with other cards, like Push the Limit (EPT)"},
    "Sensor Jammer":{"rating":3,"text":"An oft, underappreciated card, Sensor Jammer is excellent at strengthening the resiliency of the ship it is equipped to. It forces the opponent to spend their focus token when attacking you, which in turn allows you to attack back against the enemy, and they will not have a focus back for defense. Also, if the opponent does not have a focus token, sensor jammer simply reduces their attack roll by one. Use Sensor Jammer to protect high-agility, high value pilots with low hit points, or low agility targets with very high hit points. The only real downside of Sensor Jammer is its high cost."},
    "Darth Vader(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Darth Vader is an exceptional card when put on the right ship. His ability completely ignores defense dice, as even if the attack is blocked, you can still trigger Vader’s ability. Vader is best utilized against low hull, high agility ships, and is at his best when fielded on ships with high hit points, such as the Lambda-Class Shuttle, VT-49 Decimator, or TIE Shuttle titled TIE Bomber."},
    "Rebel Captive(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Rebel Captive is great for lists that do not run a lot of ships. Rebel Captive is best on a ship that the opponent would normally want to target frequently, thus dissuading the attack. Rebel Captive can be quite potent, but the opponent can also play around it a little, as only the first ship to attack gets the stress token. Still, this upgrade is very powerful and can have an entire squad built around it."},
    "Flight Instructor(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"While not a bad card, it is a little pricy for what it does. It is also very comparable to Sensor Jammer (Systems) and Sensor Jammer is usually stronger. That is not to say that Flight Instructor is a bad card, as it definitely improves survivability, especially against PS 1-2 ships. That fact that it is a crew card (valuable upgrade slot) and that it is probably about a point too expensive typically keeps this upgrade in the binder, but ships focused on defense should definitely take a look at this card, as it is not bad."},
    "Navigator(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Navigator does not see a lot of play. While it is a fine ability, there is usually a stronger contender for the crew slot. That being said, being able to change your maneuver after seeing where other ships have moved is a powerful effect. High PS ships can make more use out of this card than lower PS ones. Equipped to Boba Fett (Imperial Firespray-31), Navigator becomes quite powerful, as the changes that he can make to the selected maneuver when activating becomes quite formidable. Navigator is also good when combed with Intelligence Agent (Crew)."},
    "Opportunist":{"rating":2,"text":"While expensive, Opportunist does not conflict with your action economy, which makes it more attractive than some of its cheaper alternatives. Opportunist is at its best when you have pilots or other upgrades that promote the removal or spending of enemy focus and/or evade tokens, like Wes Jensen (X-wing) and Palob Godalhi (HWK-290). When utilized this way, Opportunist can be quite powerful."},
    "Comm Relay":{"rating":2,"text":"Comm Relay is a very strong upgrade that combos well with effects that utilize evade tokens. As long as the ship it is equipped to can take the evade action, the Comm Relay is just a strictly better Hull Upgrade (Modification). Comm Relay combos really well with Juke (EPT) on higher PS pilots, offering augmented attack and defense efficiently."},
    "Comms Booster":{"text":
    "<strong>Energy:</strong> Spend 1 energy to remove all stress tokens from a friendly ship at Range 1-3.  Then assign 1 focus token to that ship."},
    "Slicer Tools":{"text":
    "%ACTION% Choose 1 or more ships at Range 1-3 that have a stress token.  For each ship chosen, you may spend 1 energy to cause that ship to suffer 1 damage."},
    "Shield Projector":{"text":
    "When an enemy ship is declaring either a small or large ship as the target of its attack, you may spend 3 energy to force that ship to target you if possible."},
    "Ion Pulse Missiles":{"rating":1,"text":"An underappreciated missile, the Ion Pulse Missiles can completely cripple a target with ion tokens, INCLUDING large base ships. This attack also has a good chance of hitting as well, as the target lock is not discarded to perform the attack. It can be a very effective strategy to have one ship equipped with these missiles to lock an enemy down for next round, and then have a more agile ship swoop in to prey upon the ionned enemy. This all being said, these missiles are a little pricy for what they bring to bear, but the card is far from bad."},
    "Wingman":{"rating":1,"text":"Wingman is an underappreciated upgrade that is oft forgotten. Some effects have stress as a downside of the ability, like Push the Limit (EPT) and Rage (EPT). Wingman can really help in mitigating that downside, especially in your squad already likes to fly in formation. It is important to keep this upgrade in mind when building your list with stress-downsides. However, it can be hard to justify this card especially since it takes up an EPT for another ship and it has a range one restriction. For that reason, it does not see a ton of play."},
    "Decoy":{"rating":1,"text":"Decoy is very fringe playable. It really only has usefulness when a pilot ability or upgrade needs very high (or very low) PS in order to operate at maximum effectiveness. The TIE Phantom with Advanced Cloaking Device (Modification) is the best example of this. Pair a TIE Phantom with Decoy with an extremely high PS ship. Other than that example, for the most part, Decoy is not very useful."},
    "Outmaneuver":{"rating":2,"text":"Outmaneuver is a solid upgrade for maneuverable ships that are good at arc dodging. Outmaneuver is comparable to Predator (EPT), where Predator slightly outperforms it. However, Outmaneuver does perform well with ships that have axillary firing arcs. Also, reducing the agility of the opponent can be stronger than rerolling attack dice, as it increases the overall damage output better than a reroll. The work that a pilot needs to put in to make Outmaneuver work though, is often a little more than the card is worth, especially with some of the zero agility ships that exist now."},
    "Predator":{"rating":3,"text":"Predator is the staple EPT for delivering consistent damage. All other damage increasing EPTs are compared directly to Predator. It is doubtful that the game could be balanced if an EPT more efficient than Predator was printed. Predator is often compared to Push the Limit (EPT) and sometimes Outmaneuver. Predator tends to favor ships that don't need multiple actions a turn to perform well. Predator also increases the versatility of a ship's available actions, as a pilot is more willing to perform a positioning action like boost or barrel roll because they know Predator will help with accuracy. Predator also preys on low PS ships, which is always something to consider when squad building with PS 1-2."},
    "Flechette Torpedoes":{"rating":1,"text":"While not an exceptional card, the Flechette Toredoes cause stress even when they do not hit, which is a pretty exceptional boon to the card. While it is debatable whether these torpedoes are worth two points, they combo quite well with Munitions Failsafe (Modification), as if you intentionally miss with the Flechette Torpedoes, the Munitions Failsafe will keep them from getting discarded. Intentionally missing still causes the stress, which can be powerful against ships banking on their actions and red maneuvers."},
    "R7 Astromech":{"rating":1,"text":"R7 Astromech only works well with pilots that can acquire target locks on attacking enemy ships with ease. Tarn Mison (T-65 X-wing) is actually quite strong with this upgrade, but other than him, R7 Astromech has a hard time finding a place. Tarn’s jousting value gets quite high with R7 Astromech though, so definitely consider pairing this upgrade with him."},
    "R7-T1":{"rating":1,"text":"While action efficiency is usually good, this Astromech seems a lot better than it really is. The fact that the enemy ship has to be within range 1-2 and in-arc makes this effect relatively difficult to achieve. Also, the fact that the Astromech costs three points means that you are going to be wanted to get some serious mileage out of this upgrade, which it can be difficult to do. That being said, if the pilot R7-T1 is equipped to specializes in utilizing target locks in some way, there can be some more incentive to utilize this upgrade. For the most part though, there are better options available."},
    "Tactician(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Tactician is a great control card. Utilized well, tactician can absolutely cripple an enemy ship, especially if multiple Tacticians attack the same target during the course of a round. Tactician is great on B-wings, G-1A Starfighters, K-wings, YV-666s, and more. The trick is to get the enemy into your range 2 band, which while difficult sometimes, can also be used to your advantage, as the enemy will try desperately to avoid the range 2 band against you."},
    "R2-D2(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"While a very niche upgrade card, R2-D2 can be a very strong one. This upgrade is at its best when paired with C-3PO on a YT-1300 and the Millennium Falcon title. With an evade token, C-3PO, and R2-D2’s effect recovering a shield each turn, the YT-1300 completed shrugs off one attack a turn. Granted, the YT-1300 needs to avoid taking a damage card and just losing its shields, but if it can pull that off, the end game against a Millennium Falcon supported by R2-D2 and C-3PO is an exercise in futility."},
    "C-3PO(Crew)":{"rating":3,"text":"C-3PO is a very powerful upgrade. His damage mitigation is unparalleled on ships with 1 agility. Putting him on a YT-1300 or a K-wing is usually the best, but a case can be made for him to be put onto some tankier ships with 2 agility, such as the YT-2400. With 1 agility ships, you can just guess zero evade results in order to guarantee a block. Over the course of a round, C-3PO should pay for himself may times over, as he contributes to the immense resiliency of the ship he is equipped to.

The 'Stress-bot' is deceptively powerful at inflicting crippling stress upon the opponent, especially “Ace” type pilots who are high PS, high repositioning ships that tend to rely on Push the Limit (EPT) for their efficiency. While R3-A2 can be played on a variety of Rebel ships, the best use for it is on a Y-wing equipped with its BTL-A4 Y-Wing title and a cannon (usually a Twin Laser Turret or an Ion Cannon), which allows R3-A2 to trigger twice a turn. R3-A2 can strike fear into the heart of “Ace” pilots, and the hate the R3-A2 ship creates will enable the rest of your squad to have less attention drawn toward them, which can be used to your advantage."},
    "R2-D6":{"rating":1,"text":"R2-D6 is a niche upgrade that is occasionally useful at granting an EPT to a pilot that does not normally have access to one. A few X-wing and Y-wing pilots can make use of an EPT, but the point and slot that R2-D6 takes up are often not worth it, even at only one cost. Integrated Astromech (Modification) does make R2-D6 more effective though, at least for X-wings."},
    "Enhanced Scopes":{"rating":1,"text":"This is a fringe card that is occasionally useful when a ship has a higher PS but wants to gain the benefits of blocking or to be able to more effectively use mines. While not a bad card, the systems upgrade slot is usually a highly contested slot, so it can be difficult to fit this upgrade slot on a ship that it could be useful on simply because other systems upgrades can be so potent."},
    "Chardaan Refit":{"rating":3,"text":"Chardaan Refit does not really qualify as a missile upgrade, as it is not a missile. Thematically, it represents the A-wing having its missile carrying capacities removed to streamline the cost. Whenever you have an A-wing without a missile, you equip Chardaan Refit. Proton Rockets (Missile) are probably the only missile worth equipping to an A-wing, as the -2 squad point cost is rather enticing."},
    "Proton Rockets":{"rating":2,"text":"A Missile for 'Aces' to use, the Proton Rockets are only ever worth equipping to a ship with 3 agility. A-wings and TIE Advanced are great carriers of this upgrade. If possible, try to line up the shot to also have a target lock on the enemy. The range 1 limitation of this missile keeps it from being too powerful, as “Aces” often excel at range control."},
    "Kyle Katarn(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Kyle is a solid crew card. Action economy is always good, and he synergies well with abilities that cause stress. He is in competition with Kanan Jarrus and unfortunately Kanan use better more often, but Kyle has a lot of synergy with Jan Ors (Crew and pilot)."},
    "Jan Ors(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Jan Ors is a niche crew card, but one that a squad can be built around successfully. She is best used when a ship is receiving multiple focus tokens over the course of a round so that Jan can turn one of them into an evade. She tends to work best in conjunction with the Moldy Crow title attached to a HWK-290, but there are other ways to make use of her ability wish multi-action cards like Recon Specialist (Crew) and Kyle Katarn (Crew and pilot)."},

This Astromech is very cheap and adds a ton of resiliency to the ship it is equipped to, as long as that ship does not mind being stressed. Biggs Darklighter (T-65 X-wing) and most Y-wing pilots can benefit strongly from R4-D6's added resiliency. On X-wings, the added resiliency is augmented even more with Integrated Astromech (Modification)."},
    "R5-P9":{"rating":2,"text":"R5-P9 is another strong Rebel regeneration upgrade card. It can be difficult to hold onto a focus token throughout the whole round, so this is an upgrade that needs to have the whole squad built around it. Garven Dreis (T-65 X-wing) and other focus passing ships such as Kyle Katarn (HWK-290) can help make this card stronger. Poe Dameron (T-70 X-wing) is also specifically built for this upgrade. Biggs Darklighter (T-65 X-wing) can make use of this upgrade if he gets the focus token through another ability. This is not a super common upgrade to see, but it is a very powerful one when included on the right pilot in the right squad."},

Because of this, Han is only really valuable on ships that consistently get both the target lock and focus actions (so the ship can use focus on defense; an evade also works). These ships are not very common for the Rebels and he occupies the valuable crew slot, which makes Han Solo a card that you have to work hard to get to use. When you do find a spot for him though, he really amps up the offensive capacity of your target locks."},
    "Leia Organa(Crew)":{"rating":0,"text":"Leia Organa is sadly a terrible upgrade card. She is grossly overpriced and is not even that impactful. She can be okay in Epic games, but in a 100 point standard game, she is unplayable."},

    "Lando Calrissian(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Lando is a really fun card, and thematic too, as Lando’s card exemplifies his inclination for gambling. Unfortunately, he is a little expensive for an inconsistent effect, but that should not stop you from playing with him occasionally, as his flavor/theme is spot on."},
    "Mara Jade(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Mara Jade is very powerful in Imperial control lists, or for ships that love to jam themselves into enemy formations. She is most useful on VV-49 Decimators and TIE Shuttle titled TIE Bombers. Her only issue is that she does not cause stress to enemy ships that are already stressed, so if the enemy ships are already self-stressing, Mara Jade’s utility drops considerably."},
    "Fleet Officer(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Fleet Officer grants two other ships in your squad a free focus token at the cost of your action and a stress. This can be powerful in ordnance lists that like to fire their missiles and torpedoes with a focus token to help modify them. Beyond that though, this upgrade has limited uses. The best place for fleet officer is on a TIE Shuttle titled TIE Bomber, as that is very cheap support platform that suits Fleet Officer well."},
    "Lone Wolf":{"rating":3,"text":"Lone Wolf is a very powerful upgrade. Its efficiency is off the charts... when the downside is mitigated. Lone Wolf is best in two-ship builds where it is easier to keep your ships apart. Also, Lone Wolf loses a lot of efficiency with ships that only have one evade die, so also keep that in mind. Lone Wolf should always be on your radar when constructing a two ship list, or even three ship lists if you are confident in your flying. Lone Wolf is often compared to Push the Limit (EPT), Predator (EPT), and to a lesser extent, Outmaneuver (EPT)."},
    "Stay On Target":{"rating":1,"text":"Intended as a solution to help higher PS pilots back when they were struggling a little against the efficiency of lower PS ships, Stay on Target has since struggled to find its place. While its ability is useful and it favors higher PS, it tends to be a trap upgrade, as most of the time, if you are a strong player, your maneuver will usually be what you want. Therefore, the utility of this upgrade goes down when the player skill goes up. Push the Limit (EPT) usually fills the same role and is much more effective and versatile than Stay on Target."},
    "Dash Rendar(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"While not a bad upgrade, there is almost always a better choice. Dash Rendar only allows his ship to ignore obstacles during the Combat Phase, so any obstacles hit during the Activation Phase still inflict their harm on the ship. It is for that reason that Dash does not see much play."},
    "'Leebo'(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"“Leebo” is an underappreciated upgrade. “Leebo” is an Engine Upgrade (Modification) that costs two fewer points. Unfortunately, that discount comes with a drawback. However, large base ships aren’t affected by ion tokens until they get two of them, so putting “Leebo” on a large base ship has merit. Also, comboing “Leebo” with Electronic Baffle (Systems) helps mitigate the downside of the ion token, as well as still being cheaper than an Engine Upgrade."},
    "Ruthlessness":{"rating":2,"text":"Ruthlessness is a very interesting upgrade, as it has a very large upside, with a very large downside as well. This is the definition of high-risk, high -reward. Therefore, Ruthlessness tends to not see too much competitive play as it is too risky to rely on as its downside is that your own ships can take damage from it. However, the effectiveness of Ruthlessness goes way up when used on a ship that attacks multiple times per round, such as TIE/D titled TIE Defenders. Use at your own risk."},
    "Intimidation":{"rating":1,"text":"Intimidation is a niche upgrade that works best on pilots that that already want to be bumping into enemy ships. Sometimes it is hard to use the EPT slot for Intimidation, but when it can be equipped, when combined with other effects’ desires to bump, Intimidation is worth its points."},
    "Ysanne Isard(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Ysanne Isard is best on low agility, high hull ships, like the VT-49 Decimator. She is well worth her points in regards to increasing the survivability of the ship she is equipped to. The Decimator is a natural fit for Ysanne. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of other places where she is very effective, as there are not very many Imperial ships with extremely high hull values."},
    "Moff Jerjerrod(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"When there are multiple other crew cards on Moff Jerjerrod’s ship, he can be effective at maintaining the survivability of the ship by cancelling critical damage. That being said, he is only really useful on the VT-49 Decimator, and even then, there are many other options available."},
    "Ion Torpedoes":{"rating":1,"text":"Ion Torpedoes are in a similar situation of Assault Missiles. They can be extremely powerful against certain enemy squads, while at other times against squads with a low ship count, the Ion Torpedoes lose a lot of their viability. The inconsistent nature of Ion Torpedoes keeps them off of the table, but they are definitely not a bad upgrade... just not a consistent one."},
    "Bodyguard":{"rating":0,"text":"Bodyguard is not a very useful upgrade. It works best on pilots that can generate extra focus tokens like HWK-290s equipped with the Moldy Crow title. The key is making sure that the ships you are protecting with this are going to be attacked by the enemy, which can be difficult both in squad building and in gameplay. The range restriction and the PS requirement make you really have to work hard to get benefit from this ability, and the benefit is not that great. Usually a better card can be used than Bodyguard, it is not recommended."},
    "Calculation":{"rating":1,"text":"Calculation is a niche upgrade, but it is cheap. Use this upgrade if you have a pilot or upgrade card equipped to this ship that benefits from getting critical hits, like Bossk (YV-666). Bear in mind, that when you spend a focus token for this effect, you can only change 1 focus result, so the efficiency of this card is only worth it if you are getting additional benefits from critical hits."},
    "Accuracy Corrector":{"rating":2,"text":"Accuracy Corrector is a very strong card that adds a minimum threshold of consistency to your attacks. Accuracy Corrector is best on 2-attack ships, so that they are gaining the most out of the upgrade. Accuracy Corrector loses its effectiveness on ships with 3 or more attack dice though. TIE Advanced are great candidates for this upgrade card. In addition, because your attacks will always be at least 2 damage, this frees up the ship it is equipped to take repositioning actions or evade actions."},
    "Inertial Dampeners":{"rating":2,"text":"Inertial Dampeners is a great positional card. The fact that the opponent does not know if/when you are going to use it makes it have an impact on the opponent’s play even if you never end up using the card. This card is great on naturally fast ships or large base ships, as coming to a full stop is stronger there. Also, it is best if the equipped ship has ways to modify dice other than by taking a normal action, as there is stress caused by Inertial Dampeners. Inertial Dampeners is also a little stronger on ships with more green maneuvers, as clearing the stress is then easier."},
    "Flechette Cannon":{"rating":1,"text":"Flechette Cannon is a fine upgrade that sees occasional play. Its best use is on TIE/D titled Defenders to allow for a second attack. The main issue with the Flechette Cannon is that is cannot cause a target to have more than one stress, which would prove to be effective at locking down enemy ships. While Flechette Cannon is not a bad upgrade, it is often outshone by the cheaper Tractor Beam (Cannon) and slightly more expensive Ion Cannon, which have powerful secondary effects that are more impactful, unlike the Flechette Cannon's conditional stress."},
    "'Mangler' Cannon":{"rating":2,"text":"The most standard of the attacks offered by cannons, the “Mangler” Cannon is also modestly priced, coming in at four points. While this cannon does nothing fancy, the fact that it consistently produces critical hits makes this a quite attractive option. Combining this effect with others that combo well with critical hits, such as Bossk (YV-666), can cause the “Mangler” Cannon to pay off much more than its cost would suggest."},
    "Dead Man's Switch":{"rating":0,"text":"Dead Man’s Switch is a poor upgrade. Its advantages do not outweigh the outsides. It is effectively a Seismic Charge (Bomb) that the OPPONENT gets to decide when to trigger. The fact that Dead Man’s Switch is not optional just kills the card."},
    "Feedback Array":{"rating":2,"text":"While it may not seem like it upon first glance, Feedback Array is a strong upgrade. While the ion token, self-damage, and the forfeit of an attack seem harsh, the fact that this deals damage DIRECTLY to the opponent, completely ignoring defense dice makes this card strong. Feedback Array performs best on ships that have a lot of overall hit points for their cost, such as the Z-95 Headhunter or JumpMaster 5000. Also, on large base ships, the ion token can be mitigated. Feedback Array is an excellent upgrade for fighting of highly agile, token defended ships. Compared to Black Market Slicer Tools, Feedback Array loses some of its utility, but it is still a strong choice for large base ships, due to the ignoring of singe ion tokens."},
	"Hotshot Co-Pilot(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Hotshot Co-pilot is a crew that taxes enemy ships for their actions. It can be effective against enemy ships that rely on their focus tokens for defense or other abilities. This allows the rest of your list to be able to attack the same target knowing that there will not be a focus token there on defense. That being said, this crew is a little expensive. This is an upgrade that requires a list to be built around it to be effective, but it definitely is an effective upgrade."},
    "'Hot Shot' Blaster":{"rating":1,"text":"A little on the expensive side for what it does, the “Hot Shot” Blaster gives any ship with the illicit upgrade slot the ability to execute one attack from outside its firing arc. While this is a powerful ability, the fact that it costs three points, is limited to range 1-2, and discards after use tends to keep this card in the binders. The “Hot Shot” Blaster can help out a less maneuverable get shots on a target when it normally would not be able to. While it is not bad, there are just better options available for the same or less cost."},
    "Greedo(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Greedo is a card that is often overlooked, but a ship can be built to mitigate his downside. Ships that hit hard and have hit shield values are preferred for the inclusion of Greedo. Bossk (YV-666), for example, can use Greedo pretty effectively, as he can hit hard, but can shrug off damage reasonably well. That being said, it often takes a good bit of work to make Greedo pay off, which isn’t to say that it cannot be done, but it can be difficult, and some players just go with different upgrade cards because of that."},
    "Salvaged Astromech":{"rating":0,"text":"Basically a cheaper Shield Upgrade (Modification) that is harder to trigger, Salvaged Astromech is not a very strong upgrade. There is not an effective use for this card yet, so it should be avoided, as it does not contribute enough for its cost."},
    "Bomb Loadout":{"rating":1,"text":"Bomb Loadout is not really a torpedo upgrade. It is just a way to get bomb upgrades equipped to a Y-wing by basically swapping a torpedo upgrade slot for a bomb upgrade slot. Bombs can be very effective on Y-wings, so definitely consider trying this upgrade occasionally."},
    "'Genius'":{"rating":1,"text":"“Genius” is only useful on Y-wings that have bombs equipped with the Bomb Loadout (Torpedo) upgrade. While it is not that amazing of an effect, it costs zero points, so for providing some versatility in bomb use, it is worth including. It is important to note that whatever ship is dropping the bomb due to “Genius’s” ability will be most likely suffering the effects of that bomb as well."},
    "Unhinged Astromech":{"rating":2,"text":"Unhinged Astromech is very similar to its Rebel counterpart R2 Astromech. Changing all of the speed 3 maneuvers on a ship’s dial is a huge deal, and makes Y-wings and JumpMaster 5000s have much more versatile dials. This is a very solid card for granting more flexibility in the maneuvering abilities of those ships."},
    "R4-B11":{"rating":1,"text":"R4-B11 is a very unique Salvaged Astromech. Unfortunately, it is a little too expensive to find a common place in lists. However, Drea Renthal can utilize R4-B11 to maximum effect, especially when firing torpedoes or utilizing a turret weapon, crippling targets by nerfing their agility dice. Other than with Drea though, R4-B11 does not do enough for its cost."},
    "Autoblaster Turret":{"rating":2,"text":"Autoblaster Turret is a very solid upgrade. Being able to ignore defense dice in a 360 radius for only two points is a solid buy. While the range is very limited, the fear that this upgrade can cause in the way the opponent maneuvers their ships can be worth the two points alone. The Autoblaster Turret can be effective on just about any ship with the ability to take a turret upgrade."},
    "R4 Agromech":{"rating":2,"text":"R4 Agromech is an efficient way to modify dice during an attack. Unfortunately, spending a focus BEFORE gaining the target lock is a sub-optimal way to do those actions, but for only two points, the R4 Agromech can help make attacks more accurate. Any dice modifying upgrades should always be considered when squad building."},
    "K4 Security Droid(Crew)":{"rating":3,"text":"K4 Security Droid is a very efficient card that is in the same realm as Predator (EPT) and Push the Limit (EPT). Free actions are always something to keep an eye on when squad building. Gaining a free target lock can also help with ordnance focused builds."},
    "Outlaw Tech(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Similar to K4 Security Droid (Crew), Outlaw Tech provides another way for Scum ships to gain free dice modification. This upgrade is a little harder to use effectively though, as red maneuvers are very constricting to the ship that is doing them. Therefore, this upgrade is best on ships that can ignore the downsides of stress from red maneuvers, such as ships equipped with Electronic Baffle (Systems)."},
    "Advanced Targeting Computer":{"rating":3,"text":"The Advanced Targeting Computer can only be equipped to the TIE Advanced, and in doing so, has its cost reduced by 4. This effect is very powerful on higher pilot skill TIE Advanced such as Darth Vader and Maarek Steele, and combos well with cards that trigger off of critical hits. Adding an automatic critical die to every attack is an amazing ability, and this card should always be considered on TIE Advanced."},
    "Ion Cannon Battery":{"text":
    "<strong>Attack (energy):</strong> Spend 2 energy from this card to perform this attack.  If this attack hits, the defender suffers 1 critical damage and receives 1 ion token.  Then cancel <strong>all</strong> dice results."},
    "Stealth Device":{"rating":1,"text":"Stealth Device only has a few practical uses. It only deserves play on ships that have 3 or more agility, and in order for Stealth Device to pay off, there need to be multiple instances of defensive modifiers to keep Stealth Device from getting discarded. The best example of this is a Soontir Fel (TIE Interceptor) equipped with Push the Limit (EPT), Royal Guard TIE (Title), Stealth Device, and Autothrusters (Modification). Here, Stealth Device is augmented by, focus and/or evade tokens, the natural 3 agility, and Autothrusters. Without those other effects, Steal Device simply is not worth the cost."},
    "Shield Upgrade":{"rating":1,"text":"Similar to Hull Upgrade (Modification), Shield Upgrade is grossly (and intentionally) overcosted for its effect. It has fringe uses as a way to protect lynchpin ships such as “Howlrunner.” Other than that, Shield Upgrade should almost never see play."},
    "Engine Upgrade":{"rating":3,"text":"Engine Upgrade is an exceptional card; while it might not seem very impressive, the boost action is arguably the best action in the game (besides focus perhaps). This upgrade grants a ship a very large degree of maneuverability, and if the ship has other dice modification effects, the ship won’t lose out on firepower. The best places for this upgrade tend to be on large base PWTs, as they want to dodge as any enemy arcs as possible while still blasting away with their turret weapon."},
    "Anti-Pursuit Lasers":{"rating":1,"text":"Anti-Pursuit Lasers is a solid upgrade in lists that run tankier, large-base ships that are dedicated blockers. Being able to deal free damage in addition to blocking the enemy is excellent, and can force the opponent to attempt wild maneuvers just to avoid bumping into your Anti-Pursuit Lasers equipped ship. That being said, it has a 50% hit rate, so it is not very consistent (unless Emperor Palpatine, Crew, is in your squad). Compared to Ion Projector (Modification), Anti-Pursuit Lasers is better in squads that has less maneuverable ships, as it needs all the free damage it can get, and the Ion Projector’s ion tokens may not be as powerful if the ships cannot capitalize on it."},
    "Targeting Computer":{"rating":0,"text":"Targeting Computer is not good. There are exceptionally few instances where this card even has any tangible upside, as most ships have the target lock action. In addition, this upgrade costs a whopping 2 points for such a minor effect. Finally, taking up the modification slot makes this card just unplayable. It may be useful someday for a ship that can combo exceptionally well with target locks but does not natively have the target lock action. Also this card wants to think it can be on a TIE Interceptor due to the existence of the Royal Guard TIE (title) upgrade, but even then, this card is too expensive for too little gain."},
    "Hull Upgrade":{"rating":1,"text":"A statistically terrible upgrade, hull upgrade is almost never worth its 3 points. In order to get any value out of this card, you need to be getting a ton of value out of that one hit point. For example, a TIE Shuttle titled TIE Bomber with Darth Vader (Crew) may equip a Hull Upgrade to get another use out of Vader. Tel Trevura (JumpMaster 5000) is also a good candidate for Hull Upgrade, as it is basically a two hull increase instead of one."},
    "Munitions Failsafe":{"rating":1,"text":"Munitions Failsafe is garbage. It should not cost any points, as it isn’t worth it for zero points. However, the only thing keeping this card from a score of zero is the combo with Flechette Torpedoes. If the torpedo misses (which is desired), it still causes stress, and Munitions Failsafe keeps the torpedo from discarding. There are not many useful applications for this combo, but it can be run occasionally on some ships, such as Coran Horn (E-wing)."},
    "Stygium Particle Accelerator":{"rating":2,"text":"A natural fit on low PS TIE Phantoms, the Stygium Particle Accelerator allows greater jousting efficiency for the TIE Phantoms to decloak up close to an enemy ship, get the free evade token, and then take another action. Also, Sygium Particle Accelerator is not limited to TIE Phantoms, so ships equipped with a Cloaking Device (Illicit) can take advantage of this upgrade, although the volatile nature of Cloaking Device can cause the Stygium Particle Accelerator to not be worth its points."},
    "Cloaking Device":{"rating":1,"text":"Cloaking Device is an underappreciated card. While it does have a chance to fail, good players know not to use the cloaking device if its failure would be back-breaking for them. Instead, the Cloaking Device is best when used primarily as an extreme repositioning action and only used for the agility dice as a secondary priority only when necessary. Its best use is to cloak prior to an engagement and then decloak at the start of the next Activation Phase to lurch into range one of the enemy and hopefully out of arc. That all being said, you need to have a specific plan for Cloaking Device, as its chance to fail keeps this card from seeing too much play."},
    "Advanced Cloaking Device":{"rating":3,"text":"The Advanced Cloaking Device is available only to the TIE Phantom. This upgrade is best on the higher PS TIE Phantoms, as this upgrade allows the ship to cloak immediately after attacking, thus allowing the ship to have two additional evade dice for ships returning fire. Also, this sets the ship up for a decloak next turn. It is basically required on “Whisper” and “Echo,” and is not a bad buy on the low PS Phantoms either. This upgrade loses its effectiveness against higher PS ships, and in those situations, the player needs to take maneuvers and actions in such a way to avoid taking damage before getting the chance to fire and trigger Advanced Cloaking Device. The Stigium Partical Accelerator (Modification) is better on the lower PS TIE Phantoms."},
    "Combat Retrofit":{"text":
    "Increase your hull value by 2 and your shield value by 1."},
    "B-Wing/E2":{"rating":1,"text":"The B-Wing/E2 upgrade is a niche upgrade that allows the B-wing to equip crew upgrades. While B-wings are usually best when run slim (few upgrades), there are a few crew members that can be very effective. Namely, Tactician (Crew), as this crew turns the B-wing into a very effective control ship. While there are a few other crew that can complement the B-wing well, keeping the overall cost of the ship down is key."},
    "Countermeasures":{"rating":1,"text":"Countermeasures is a card that is slightly overpriced and is competing for a spot that many high powered modifications are vying for. While Countermeasures is strong against lists that use munitions or a swarm of ships, the fact that it costs 3 points and takes the place of the esteemed Engine Upgrade (Modification) keeps this upgrade in the binder. It can be effective in Dengar and Manaroo lists (both JumpMaster 5000s)."},
    "Experimental Interface":{"rating":1,"text":"Experimental Interface is a strong upgrade that can have a hard time finding a place. It is basically a Push the Limit (EPT) for upgrade card actions, instead of action bar actions. That is a very strong effect, but the trick is to find the right combination of upgrades that work with this card to make it worth it. Daredevil (EPT), Expose (EPT), and “Gonk” (Crew) are all possible combo pieces for Experimental Interface. While it is definitely a strong card, there are not a ton of ways to take full advantage of it right now, so it does not see a ton of play."},
    "Tactical Jammer":{"rating":1,"text":"Tactical Jammer is a very weak card. It is worthless in almost every sense, as it is exceptionally rare that a ship would want to attack a ship that is farther away than a ship that is closer, not to mention the difficulty it takes in getting the ship equipped with Tactical Jammer in the way to block the attack in the first place. However, Biggs Darklighter (T-65 X-wing) can force the opponent to attack him, so Tactical Jammer can be effective in the right squad with him, especially on large-base ships. Kanan Jarrus (VCX-100) is a solid pilot to help with this combo."},
    "Autothrusters":{"rating":3,"text":"Autothrusters is a fantastic upgrade. It is basically required on any ship that is a dedicated Arc- Dodger, so that it does not suffer against PWTs. While it can only be equipped to ships with the boost action, those are the ships that benefit from this the most anyways. In addition to helping greatly against Arc-Dodger’s greatest weakness (turrets), it also triggers while in range 3, which makes Arc-Dodgers much stronger in the range 3 band, where they tend to have a hard time dodging arcs. You need a darn good reason not to run this on a high PS Arc-Dodger. Even ships with lower PS can gain a benefit from Autothrusters for the added resiliency, although it is not as effective there."},
    "Slave I":{"rating":2, "text":"The Firespray-31 has two titles, the Slave I and the Andrasta. Both are very similar, as they both grant upgrade icons and both cost zero points. Use Slave I if you want to equip high cost bombs to your ship, as you can then equip Extra Munitions (Torpedo) to grant you extra uses of those bombs. Also, using the Slave I title grants the use of missiles in conjunction with Extra Munitions. Finally, Long-Range Sensors (Modification) can be equipped to the Firespray-31 if the Slave I title is equipped, which can be very useful even if there are not missiles or torpedoes equipped, as it offers the ship added flexibility with target locks."},
    "Millennium Falcon":{"rating":3,"text":"The Millennium Falcon title (Original Trilogy version) is a staple on almost every named YT-1300, as it offers the ship much needed resiliency. Offensive dice modification can be accomplished with an EPT or crew upgrades, which allow the evade action to be taken often."},
    "Moldy Crow":{"rating":2,"text":"The Moldy Crow title is a fantastic enhancement to the HWK-290. Combined with Recon Specialist (Crew), the Moldy Crow can generate an obscene amount of focus tokens, which can be used by pilot abilities, such as Kyle Katarn (HWK-290), or for firing a Blaster Turret. Either way, the efficiency that this title provides to the HWK-290 is definitely worth the points on the unique pilots with those aforementioned upgrades. In order to get the most value out of this title, make sure to move your squad as slowly as possible during the first few rounds of the game so that you can stack as many focus tokens on the ship as possible."},
    "ST-321":{"rating":0,"text":"While the ST-321 has some utility with Colonel Jendon, this upgrade ultimately is a Long-Range Sensor upgrade that is 2 points overcosted, which makes this upgrade essentially unplayable."},
    "Royal Guard TIE":{"rating":3,"text":"The Royal Guard TIE title grants higher PS TIE Interceptors to equip two modifications, which is an amazing ability, as modifications tend to be some of the strongest upgrades in the game. Most of the time, Autothrusters is the main choice, as it is a natural fit on TIE Interceptors. After that, Stealth Device, Shield Upgrade, Hull Upgrade, and Twin Ion Engine Mk. II are all fantastic choices that be really amp up the effectiveness of the TIE Interceptor. When you are paying a large part of your squad points on a really fragile ship like the TIE Interceptor, you want to make sure that the ship performs as well as it possibly can."},
    "Dodonna's Pride":{"text":
    "When you perform a coordinate action, you may choose 2 friendly ships (instead of 1).  Those ships may each perform 1 free action."},
    "A-Wing Test Pilot":{"rating":3,"text":"This upgrade showcases the highly skilled abilities of the A-wing pilots of the Rebel Alliance. Being able to equip two EPT upgrades is a HUGE boon, as EPTs are often regarded as some of the best upgrades in the game. Always take advantage of this title on A-wings, as you can always equip Adaptability (EPT) for zero points if you do not have enough points for a second EPT."},
    "Outrider":{"rating":2,"text":"The Outrider grants the unique ability to use an equipped cannon upgrade as a turret for the YT- 2400, while at the same time disabling its primary weapon. The most common use for this upgrade is to equip a Heavy Laser Cannon and to use that as a 4-dice attack that ignores range 3 bonuses. However, this creates a donut-hole in the range 1 band where the Outrider cannot attack any enemies. This upgrade makes the higher costed YT-2400s hit worth their point values. Without the title, the cannon upgrade can still be used just fine, and then the ship has access to its primary weapon as well. Whether or not to include this upgrade simply depends on the general squad composition and strategy intended for the squad (as well as being willing to invest five additional points into the ship for this title)."},
    "Dauntless":{"rating":1,"text":"Dauntless is a niche title for the YT-49 Decimator. This title helps the ship when it bumps into another ship, as it can take an action. As the Decimator is ripe for being blocked, this upgrade can be quite beneficial for some pilots that like to be aggressive. Because of the aggressive nature of this card, Captain Oicunn is typically the best pilot to sport this title."},
    "Virago":{"rating":3,"text":"The Virago title grants added customizability to the StarViper. This is essential for the unique pilots as their high costs need to have upgrades to augment their abilities."},
    "'Heavy Scyk' Interceptor":{"rating":2,"text":"The 'Heavy Scyk' Interceptor allows the M3-A Interceptor the ability to be customized in two different ways. Without the title, the M3-A is an inexpensive, Arc-Dodger-like ship that can help round out a squad. With the title equipped, the M3-A can hit extremely hard for its light frame. While the torpedo and missile upgrades are fine options, usually the Cannon upgrade is chosen for this title. Being able to equip a Heavy Laser Cannon to such a cheap platform truly defines the term: 'glass-cannon.'"},
    "'Light Scyk' Interceptor":{"text":
    "All Damage cards dealt to you are dealt faceup. You may treat all banck maneuvers (%BANKLEFT% or %BANKRIGHT%) as green maneuvers. You cannot equip Modification upgrades."},
    "IG-2000":{"rating":3,"text":"When fielding two Aggressors, these titles are essentially mandatory, as they amp up the effectiveness of the “Bro-bots” quite significantly. Being able to have both abilities of both IG-88s on both ships is an incredible ability that is not to be taken lightly. This allows a lot of customization in the composition of the Bro-bot squad, as there are a lot of different effective combinations to take advantage of. If only using one Aggressor, be mindful of the IG-88D crew upgrade to possibly equip to another ship in your squad."},
    "BTL-A4 Y-Wing":{"rating":2,"text":"The BTL-A4 Y-wing title grants the Y-wing two distinct versions. With the title, the Y-wing’s jousting efficiency skyrockets by fixing the turret forward. This is very effective with the Twin Laser Turret or the Ion Cannon Turret. Without the title, the Y-wing can be flown a lot like a PWT, and grants the ship more freedom with its maneuvers at a loss of its overall firepower. Both versions of the Y-wing are effective, and it just depends on the composition of the squad and overall strategy for the player on which version of the ship to fly."},
    "Andrasta":{"rating":1,"text":"The Firespray-31 has two titles, the Andrasta and the Slave I. Both are very similar, as they both grant upgrade icons and both cost zero points. Use Andrasta if you are equipping multiple low cost bomb upgrades to your Firespray-31. Emon Azzameen tends to prefer this title to Slave I."},
    "TIE/x1":{"rating":3,"text":"The TIE/x1 title is REQUIRED on the TIE Advanced to make it playable. Being able to equip a systems upgrade for free or at least very cheap is a huge boost. The most common systems upgrades to equip are Accuracy Corrector (better for lower PS) and Advanced Targeting Computer (better for higher PS). Fire-Control System and Sensor Jammer are also fine options."},
    "Emperor Palpatine(Crew)":{"rating":3,"text":"Emperor Palpatine is an amazing crew upgrade. His ability is very undercosted and has no range limit. His ability can even modify effects originating from non-attack related effects, like that from Anti-Pursuit Lasers (Modification). His only real downside is that he can only be equipped to ships that have two crew slots, but that is a minor drawback. His ability works extremely well on a Lambda-Class Shuttle flown alongside two “Aces” that rely on good dice to stay alive."},
     "Extra Munitions":{"rating":3,"text":"Extra Munitions is the card that allows dedicated ordnance carriers to exist. Normally, missiles and torpedoes (and sometime bombs) are just too expensive to field in mass quantities. This upgrade smooths out the cost of equipping multiple munition upgrade cards to a ship. If a ship can equip Extra Munitions with its other munition(s), the player should find a way to fit 2 more points into their squad for this card most of the time."},
        "Cluster Mines":{"rating":1,"text":"Cluster Mines are too expensive for their minimal damage output. They cover a lot of space in play, but each mine is very weak by itself. The fact that these mines can just completely whiff makes them unappealing."},
        "Glitterstim":{"rating":3,"text":"Glitterstim is fantastic. The level of dice modification this card has is off the charts. For only two points, Glitterstim turns a ship into a challenge phase monster. Glitterstim is at its best when on ships with both high attack and high agility, as well on ships that have positional actions, as focus is not too important with Glitterstim triggering. Also, Glitterstim tends to work better in squads with fewer ships, as the opponent will be more likely to be bearing multiple guns on the Glitterstim target, which improves the card’s effectiveness. While the card does cause stress, and that must be accounted for, the upsides well outweigh the cost."},
        "Bossk(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Bossk is a strong crew upgrade. He works exceptionally well with Gunner (Crew), as the second attack you make with Gunner will have the dice modifications from Bossk. Unfortunately, Bossk’s effect is mandatory, so sometimes you will need to take stress when it does not favor you to do so. Even with this drawback, though, the raw efficiency of Bossk’s effect makes him worth it in the right squad. You just need to be careful with that downside by either playing around it or having some sort of stress mitigation in your squad."},
     "Weapons Guidance":{"rating":2,"text":"While often underappreciated, Weapons Guidance greatly increases a ship's offensive capacity for only two points. Two-attack ships gain the most from this upgrade, while 3+attack ships don't get as much mileage out of it. However, if your squad only has a few ships and you need more ways to augment the offensive power of those ships, Weapons Guidance can be a very effective option."},
        "Lightning Reflexes":{"rating":1,"text":"In the same category as other discard, one point, EPTs, such as Adrenaline Rush and Cool Hand, Lightning Reflexes is similar to those other two in terms of usefulness. There are times where turning any maneuver into a K-Turn can be game changing, so it would be foolish to say that Lightning Reflexes is not strong. However, it can sometimes be hard to justify its inclusion over a more consistent effect. Lightning Reflexes is definitely worth experimenting with, though, and if there is an extra point available in your squad, it is worth a try."},
        "Twin Laser Turret":{"rating":3,"text":"Twin Laser Turret is arguably the strongest (or at least most commonly played) turret upgrade. The consistency of the damage output that this upgrade has, having a massive range, and ignoring range 3 defense bonuses, all contribute to the efficiency of this upgrade. Twin Laser Turret is extremely efficient in terms of damage output for a turret, and its balance is sometimes called into question because of it. Also, Twin Laser Turret is great at shedding/nullifying the effectiveness of defense tokens, as well as providing stead damage output against steadily crushing lower agility ships. Even though the TLT has a range 1 hole that can be exploited, the benefits of this upgrade outweigh that one downside."},
"Plasma Torpedoes":{"rating":2,"text":"A definitive option when considering torpedoes for a ship, the Plasma Torpedoes are extremely effective against ships with very high shield values, while it is a fine attack against other ships. For only 3 points, Plasma Torpedoes are a good deal for a solid attack. If you can afford the point, Proton Torpedoes are usually better, but that extra point sometimes can't be spent."},
"R5-X3":{"rating":2,"text":"A situationally useful card, for only one point, the equipped ship can ignore the downsides of an obstacle. That is a very powerful ability that is often underappreciated. The problem is that this Astromech does not combo well with Integrated Astromech (Modification) at least for X-wings, and Y-wings tend to take R2 Astromech if they can afford a 1 cost upgrade. Therefore it can be hard to R5-X3 to find a ship to call home. Nonetheless, this card should be considered when building a squad that has the Astromech upgrade slot, as its effect can be gamechanging."},
"Seismic Torpedo":{"rating":2,"text":"Seismic Torpedo is a strong upgrade. Being able to remove an obstacle from play is a very potent ability. The threat of using this also keeps enemy ships from wanting to get too close to obstacles within firing range. In addition, you can fire this torpedo with a low PS ship, and then have all of your other ships move into the space where the obstacle was. Never underestimate the influence that this upgrade can have on a game. The damage that this torpedo can deal is just a nice bonus to an already great effect."},
"BB-8":{"rating":2,"text":"BB-8 offers pilots the ability to take pre-movement repositioning actions. This is exceptionally powerful on higher PS pilots that already favor repositioning effects due to their high PS. BB-8 also does not cost an action to utilize. However, it does require a green maneuver to use, which does hamper his utility depending on the maneuver dial of the ship it is equipped to."},
	"Tractor Beam":{"rating":2,"text":"One of the few attacks in the game that cannot deal damage, the Tractor Beam is nonetheless a powerful addition to a squad. Being able to move an opponent’s ship AND reduce its agility is a huge deal, especially if you can have that ship be moved onto an obstacle or into an area where it cannot attack. The Tractor Beam token cannot move large base ships, so that restricts the viability of this card. However, for only one point, it is not difficult to slide this upgrade into a squad, especially when that squad has Defenders equipped with the TIE/D title. Also, due to the nature of the Tractor Beam reducing agility and forcing the opponent to move, this upgrade favors ships with higher PS, as you’ll want to use this effect before other ships fire."},
	"Juke":{"rating":2,"text":"Juke is a very solid upgrade. It works best on ships that already have action advantage where they can get an evade token AND another action. Also, Juke works best on higher PS pilots, as they will presumably shoot first, use Juke's ability, and then use the evade token when defending. For this reason, lower PS pilots have a harder time utilizing Juke."},
	"Cool Hand": {"rating":1,"text":"Cool hand is not a very strong upgrade. Similar in function to Adrenaline Rush (EPT), Cool Hand behaves worse usually. The only upsides of this card in comparison to Adrenaline Rush include granting an evade token to a ship that doesn't have access to one and getting involuntarily stressed (which is relevant sometimes). For the most part though, there are almost always better ways to spend 1 point."},
	"Wired":{"rating":2,"text":"Wired is an interesting card. It is a dice modifying card, which is always powerful and should be considered when building a squad. It is useful on cards that become stressed naturally AND do not get a focus token easily. These effects are not very common, but they do exist, such as “Zeta Leader” (TIE/fo Fighter) equipped with Weapons Guidance (Tech). If a pilot likes to be stressed, make sure you consider Wired for his EPT."},
	"XX-23 S-Thread Tracers":{"rating":1,"text":"A niche card requiring the whole squad to be built around it, the XX-23 S-Thread Tracers require a high PS ship to fire and hit with them to help set up a massive alpha strike with the rest of the squad. While this can be effective, the telegraphed nature of the card combined with the fact that it is limited to friendly ships within range 1-2 AND the ship firing this missile does not do damage, makes this a difficult upgrade to utilize effectively. It is worth trying on Deadeye (EPT) Lt. Blount (Z-95 Headhunter)."},
        "Ion Bombs":{"rating":2,   "text":"Ion Bombs are an underappreciated bomb. Being able to inflict 2 ion tokens to all ships within range 1 of it can completely wreck the opponent’s plans for the rest of the game. While obviously more effective against multiple ships, Ion Bombs can be scary to almost any adversary."},
        "Conner Net":{"rating":3,"text":"The Conner Net is a fantastic mine. It smashes “Aces” and fat turret ships alike, while still being relevant against most other targets. It is usually best to line up a Conner Net for be followed up by a devastating attack, as the opponent’s position should be relatively telegraphed."},
        "Bombardier(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Bombardier is not very effective. While it can definitely be worth some value on a dedicated bomber, at the same time, the crew slot is very valuable, and that slot can often be filled by a stronger alternative. Bombardier is not very expensive, but it can often struggle to be worth the point it costs to include into a squad, not to mention the opportunity cost."},
        "'Crack Shot'": {"rating":3,"text": "Crack Shot is a fantastic upgrade. It is very efficient at what it does: deal a damage. Crack Shot is more nuanced than that though. Crack Shot triggers AFTER the opponent spends evade/focus tokens, so the opponent may spend more tokens than they want to JUST to dissuade the use of Crack Shot, which is a big deal. Also, Crack Shot gives 2 dice attacks more of a punch, so a great use for this upgrade is in a swarm of EPT generics with 2 die attacks. Also, Crack Shot can also be used to great effect with hard-hitting munitions and munitions that have 'if this attack hits' effects. Overall, Crack Shot is a great upgrade and is almost never a waste of a point."},
        "Advanced Homing Missiles":{
	    "rating":1,
            "text":"Advanced Homing Missiles are a niche missile upgrade. They can be quite crippling, with their ability to ignore shields and deal a face-up damage card, which can destroy some less sturdy ships in one hit. While this is a neat effect, and not bad, Advanced Homing Missiles have a few things working against them. With a cost of 3, they are a little pricy for the effect they bring to the table; also, they have a range restriction of range 2 only. The range restriction is a huge deal and is the primary reason for keeping them off of the table. Also, as with some missiles, Advanced Homing Missiles do not spend their target lock when firing (they just require the TL to exist on the target), so that helps significantly with dice modification. Major Rhymer (TIE Bomber) and Lt. Blount (Z-95 Headhunter) are good candidates for Advanced Homing Missiles."},
        "Advanced SLAM":
            {"rating":2,"text": "The Advanced SLAM is really only worth it on the K-wing, as it is the only ship that can use the SLAM action more than once a game. Advanced SLAM’s main purpose is to drop a mine after SLAM-ing, which is really powerful. It does not really have another practical purpose, but being able to drop a mine after completing a SLAM action offers a lot of versatility to the K-wing as a bomber."},
        "Twin Ion Engine Mk. II":
            {"rating":2,"text": "This upgrade is very versatile, as it has upside on just about every TIE model of ship. Some TIEs are a little stronger with it than others, as the TIE Defender, TIE Punisher, and the TIE Interceptor tend to be the biggest winners in regards to this card. Also, if the equipped ship has some upgrade that causes it to suffer stress, such as Push the Limit (EPT), this upgrade becomes well worth its points due to allowing more green maneuvers."},
        "Maneuvering Fins":
            {"rating":1,"text": "Unique to the YV-666, the Maneuvering Fins upgrade is a cheap way to help higher PS YV-666s course-correct in the event that their turn maneuver needs adjusting. This upgrade helps open up the dial of the YV-666 a little more, which is good. It is not very effective on lower PS YV-666s because they are moving first anyways most likely, so an incorrect maneuver shouldn’t be assigned in the first place. Use Maneuvering Fins if you cannot afford Engine Upgrade (Modification) or if you have a spare point in your squad, but it is not an upgrade to build a list around."},
        "Ion Projector":   
            {"rating":1,"text": "Ion Projector is a solid upgrade in lists that run tankier, large-base ships that are dedicated blockers. Being able to inflict ion tokens in addition to blocking the enemy is excellent, and can force the opponent to attempt wild maneuvers just to avoid bumping into your Ion Projector equipped ship. That being said, it has a 50% hit rate, so it is not very consistent (unless Emperor Palpatine, Crew, is in your squad). Compared to Anti-Pursuit Lasers (Modification), Ion Projector is better in squads that have more maneuverable ships, as other ships in your squad will be more able to react and capitalize on the enemy ship(s) getting ionned."},
	    "Integrated Astromech":{"rating":3,"text":"Integrated Astromech is basically required on all T-65 X-wings and most T-70 X-wings that don’t run Autothrusters (Modification). This upgrade brings the X-wing’s inefficient cost back in line by allowing an equipped astromech upgrade to be used as a super shield (as you choose when to use it). Use low cost astromechs if efficiency is all that is needed and use higher cost ones for their added effects."},
        "Hound's Tooth":
            {"rating":1,"text": "The Hound’s Tooth title is a very interesting upgrade, as it allows the player to deploy a very inexpensive Z-95 Headhunter to play when the YV-666 is destroyed. In order to take full advantage of this upgrade, a unique pilot is often better, as the Nashtah Pup gains the PS and ability of the YV-666 it was deployed from. Also, the YV-666 should be built for offense, as you want the opponent to put in effort to destroy it, or to be persuaded to ignore it in order to avoid the Nashtah Pup deployment. That being said, it can be difficult to build a squad that has a high chance of forcing the opponent into engaging the Hound’s Tooth in a favorable manner for you, so it can be difficult to justify this title’s inclusion."},
     "Hera Syndulla(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Hera is a very solid crew card. She really opens up her ship’s maneuver dial. Being able to ignore half of the downsides (the other half being the inability to take actions) of stress is a huge boon, and she only costs one point. Look to use her on ships that have a lot of red maneuvers."},
     "'Chopper'(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"While “Chopper’s” ability is not very impressive, he is also zero points, which means that other than the opportunity cost of not being able to equip another crew upgrade, there is no reason not to include this upgrade. Therefore, while it is difficult to find a place where you actually build a list around it, this card sees a lot of play because it is free."},
     "'Zeb' Orrelios(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"“Zeb” is a decent choice on ships that love to block and bump enemy ships, such has “Chopper” (VCX-100). Most of the time though, the fact that the enemy ship can attack back makes it difficult for a player to get a lot of value out of “Zeb.” He can be a double edged sword, but at the same time, on a ship like the VCX-100, the VCX-100 can get more value out of attacking than most enemy ships can. Even though he is good in a few specific situations, “Zeb” is a very niche upgrade card that needs a specific purpose within a squad to deserve consideration."},
     "Ezra Bridger(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"Ezra is an interesting crew upgrade; unfortunately, due to the competition that the crew slot has, being interesting does not usually get the job done. He is a little on the expensive side for a dice modification card, and he can be difficult to make work on a ship. Clearly, he is best on a ship that likes to stress itself, like Ibtisam (B-wing), but he is usually too expensive to be worth inclusion in a list."},
     "Kanan Jarrus(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Kanan Jarrus turns every one of your white maneuvers into a green one, which works wonders with other effects that have stress as a downside, like Push the Limit (EPT). Kanan Jarrus is not even limited to the ship he is on, so he provides a lot of versatility to a squad that chooses to include him. He is a very solid crew upgrade that is comparable to Kyle Katarn (Crew)."},
     "Sabine Wren(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Sabine is a powerhouse. With the squad built around her, bombs become incredibly strong. Her ability doesn’t even have to damage the ship that the bomb initially damaged. An entire list built around Sabine and her bombs can be quite frightening. Without Sabine, the Rebels struggle to use bombs effectively, but she definitely compensates for that deficiency well."},
     "Ghost":{"rating":2, "text":"While technically two separate cards, one must equip them both to the VCX- 100 and the Attack Shuttle. These two titles allow the Attack Shuttle to be docked with the VCX-100, granting it the ability to attack from its rear arc AND to be able to fire a turret weapon at the end of the Combat Phase. This combo can be really strong, especially with Twin Laser Turret. The ability to deploy the Attack Shuttle at the opportune moment can also be extremely valuable."},
     "Phantom":{"rating":2,"text":"While technically two separate cards, one must equip them both to the VCX- 100 and the Attack Shuttle. These two titles allow the Attack Shuttle to be docked with the VCX-100, granting it the ability to attack from its rear arc AND to be able to fire a turret weapon at the end of the Combat Phase. This combo can be really strong, especially with Twin Laser Turret. The ability to deploy the Attack Shuttle at the opportune moment can also be extremely valuable."},
     "Reinforced Deflectors":{"rating":2,"text":"While there are not very many ships that can equip this upgrade (namely, the VCX-100 and the Lambda-Class Shuttle), this upgrade can be very potent in assisting with the survivability of the ship. Ships with very low agility and high heath can gain a lot of mileage out of this card. However, this card loses steam against 2-attack ships, as they will rarely deal 3 damage."},
     "Dorsal Turret":{"rating":2,"text":"While nothing special, Dorsal Turret is a cheap way to get a turret that has decent range and attack power. A Dorsal Turret can easily be slotted onto a Y-wing, HWK-290, or Attack Shuttle and will usually be worth its points. Sometimes though, if not utilizing the range 2 band of this card, Autoblaster Turret can often be a better buy."},
     "Targeting Astromech":{"rating":1,"text":"Targeting Astromech is generally not extremely useful, as it is too expensive for the occasional usefulness that it brings to the ship. However, there are some fringe cases for its inclusion in a squad. For example, 'Hobbie' Kilivian becomes a formidable pilot with Targeting Astromech equipped."},
     "TIE/D":{"rating":2,"text":"While slightly less popular than the TIE/x7 title, the TIE/D title trades the added efficiency and resiliency that the TIE/x7 title adds for a huge spike in damage potential. By equipping a Tractor Beam, Flechette Cannon, or Ion Cannon, the TIE/D can inflict a lot of damage as well as being a very potent control piece of a squad. However, it should be noted that in order to get the most out of this upgrade, there need to be dice modifications for both attacks for this upgrade to be worth it over the TIE/x7. Predator (EPT) and Ruthlessness (EPT) can help make these attacks stronger, as well as simply flying Colonel Vessery (TIE Defender)."},
     "TIE/x7":{"rating":3,"text":"As one of three different versions of the TIE Defender (TIE/x7, TIE/D, and no-title), the TIE/x7 tends to be the default option. Reducing the cost of the TIE Defender and granting a free evade token at high speeds is a fantastic ability, as it allows the Defender to play more aggressively due to its enhanced defenses. In addition, as the title grants an evade token, the TIE Defender even gets the evade token if it bumps, because it is not an action. Without either title, the TIE Defender is only really worth it with Rexlar Brath using the Heavy Laser Cannon and Predator or Lone Wolf (both EPTs)."},
     "TIE Shuttle":{"rating":2,"text":"The TIE Shuttle title offers a completely different way to outfit the TIE Bomber. Without the title, the TIE Bomber is a cheap ordnance platform. With the title, though, the TIE Bomber becomes an efficient way to house crew upgrades and act as a support or control ship. Tactician, Darth Vader, Mara Jade, and Rebel Captive are all great control options. Fleet Officer and Systems Officer are great support upgrades."},
     "Guidance Chips":{"rating":3,"text":"Guidance Chips is part of the puzzle that makes ordnance (missile and torpedo upgrades) worth using. Guidance Chips fixes all of the problems with ordnance not hitting hard enough for their cost. That being said, unless combed with Deadeye (EPT), Guidance Chips works at its best on higher PS ordnance carries, as those ships will have an easier time acquiring their target lock. While it is usually best to have some sort of modifier after firing a torpedo or missile, Guidance Chips makes it still a decent attack if you cannot afford to line up that other modification in game. For lower PS ordnance carriers, use Deadeye (EPT) or Long-Range Sensors (Modification)."},
     "TIE/v1":{"rating":2,"text":"This cheap upgrade is almost a necessity on the TIE Advanced Prototype, at least at higher PS, as it grants the ship essentially five actions. Being able to get a free evade token for taking a target lock action is a huge upside. Granted, it is easier to acquire target locks at high PS, so higher PS pilots will want this title a little more than generic pilots, but generic pilots may look to this title too to help with action economy."},
     "Mist Hunter":{"rating":2, "text":"The Mist Hunter title grants the barrel roll action and the Tractor Beam (Cannon) upgrade card to the G-1A Starfighter, allowing it to have a bit more flexibility in its repositioning ability and enemy ship control with the Tractor Beam. While not a mind-blowing upgrade, the utility that it can provide for the G-1A Starfighter cannot be ignored."},
     "Zuckuss(Crew)":{"rating":3,"text":"Zuckuss is an excellent crew upgrade. His effect allows his ship to punch through heavy agility dice. This makes him great at attacking “Ace” ships. While getting stress is a definite downside, because he can trigger while stressed, it is often that the ship he is on can just ignore stress altogether, as Zuckuss acts as the dice modifier for the ship, instead of actions. Zuckuss also pairs well with 4-LOM (Crew)."},
     "4-LOM(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"4-LOM is a very powerful crew card. For only one point, he can eliminate the enemy's tokens. This makes 4-LOM very good against “Ace” type ships, as they rely heavily on their tokens for defense. 4-LOM inflicts an ion token on the ship that it is equipped to, so you need to mitigate the somehow, by either equipping him to a large base ship or using something like Electronic Baffle (Systems). Because of the ion token downside, 4-LOM needs to be carefully considered as to whether it can be equipped to a ship or not. 4-LOM also combos really well with Zuckuss (both his pilot and crew forms)."},
     "Adaptability":{"rating":2,"text":"Adaptability is special because it is a 0 cost upgrade. The other 0 cost EPT is Trick Shot, which is stronger overall if you don’t have a specific need to increase or decrease your PS in comparison to the enemy squad. Sometimes though, there is a benefit in having ships within the same squad having Identical PS, so use Adaptability if it can be arranged. While the increase PS side is usually preferred, the decrease PS option can be useful for blocking or matching the PS of another ship in your squad."},
     "Adaptability(+1)":{"text":"Increase your pilot skill value by 1."},
     "Adaptability(-1)":{"text":"Decrease your pilot skill value by 1."},
     "Rage":{"rating":2,"text":"Rage is a powerful upgrade. Rage acts like taking a focus and target lock action for only one action. Rage also applies the rerolling ability until the end of the round, which works well for ships that attack more than once a round. Rage is also very inexpensive. Unfortunately, the downside of generating two stress is a big downside that causes many players/pilots to shy away from this card. Rage is effective on ships that fire munitions in order to maximize the effectiveness of the ordnance. Rage is also fantastic on pilots that do not care about stress, such as Tycho Celchu (A- wing)."},
     "Attanni Mindlink":{"rating":2,"text":"This is a very unique upgrade, granted only to the Scum faction. While the downside seems harsh, it is not really that bad, as only one stress token can be assigned to the ship at a time. The best way to utilize this card is to have multiple ships with the same PS equipped with this card (usually this works best with EPT generics) and to stagger the maneuvers of the ships so that the ship to perform a red maneuver can move last. Also, you want ships with multiple actions, so that you can stack focus with other actions effectively. Lastly, Attanni Mindlink assigns a focus token, which is not a focus action, which gets around action limitations."},
     "R5-P8":{"rating":1,"text":"R5-P8 is very strong in a squad with few ships, and equipped to a ship that draws enemy fire and is relatively resistant to damage. Being able to have a chance to damage an attacker through R5- P8’s effect is not to be underestimated. Unfortunately, there is a chance for the effect to fail, but since there is so much upside, this upgrade does make its way into lists."},
     "Boba Fett(Crew)":{"rating":2,"text":"Boba Fett is a very frightening upgrade, and he is very cheap, so he can be easily fit into a squad. He is at his best when equipped to a ship that has an easier time dealing critical damage, such as ships equipped with “Mangler” Cannon, Proton Torpedoes, or Calculation (EPT). His presence in a list can force the opponent to completely change their behavor towards Boba’s ship, so his relevance on the battlefield is significant even if he never triggers his effect."},
     "'Gonk'(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"“Gonk” is the Scum’s only access to regeneration effects, which is usually monopolized by the Rebels. “Gonk” is not very action efficient, but if the ship it is one has other dice modifying effects equipped, “Gonk” can prove very useful. Try him on naturally resilient ships that the opponent will want to attack, such as Tel Trevura (JumpMaster 5000). “Gonk” also combos reasonably well with Experimental Interface (Modification) which allows you to both put a shield on “Gonk,” and then immediately take one off. The main issue with “Gonk” is that his regeneration is often painfully slow, which can tend to keep him out of a lot of lists. It takes a lot of time and patience to get the most out of this upgrade."},
     "Dengar(Crew)":{"rating":3,"text":"Dengar is a fantastic upgrade; he is basically a crew verison of Predator (EPT), except that his ability gets better against unique pilots as opposed to PS 1-2 ships. Dengar greatly increases a ship’s attack capacity, and that is always a strong ability. His only real downside is that because he is a crew card, the opportunity cost of not having another crew can be high sometimes, but that does not make him any less effective."},
     "Punishing One":{"rating":2,"text":"While it seems overpriced, the Punishing One title is definitely worth its cost. Being able to add an attack die for a 360 degree turret primary weapon is very strong. It needs to be equipped to the right ship though, and not all JumpMaster 5000s need the Punishing One title to be strong. The versions that want this act as archetypical PWTs; they want to dodge as many arcs as possible and use their turret weapon to maximum effect while avoiding being shot at by the enemy. The best pilots for this title are Tel Trevura and Dengar."},
     "Long-Range Scanners":{"rating":3,"text":"Long-Range Scanners is part of the puzzle that makes ordnance (missile and torpedo upgrades) worth using. Long-Range Scanners fixes the problems that lower PS ships had at acquiring the target locks necessary for firing ordnance weapons. While that is powerful, Long-Range Scanners can only be equipped to ships with the torpedo AND missile upgrade slots. In addition, the inability for ships equipped with Long-Range Scanners to acquire target locks at ranges 1-2 can be very hampering when trying to fire ordnance at close range. Also, Long-Range Scanners telegraphs the target turns ahead of time, which can be a downside, but it can also severely impact the way the opponent flies their ships, which can be exploited. For higher PS ships that want to use ordnance, Guidance Chips (Modification) is usually preferred."},
     "Thermal Detonators":{"rating":1,"text":"Basically, a strictly upgraded Seismic Charge for one more point, Thermal Detonators scare away fragile “Aces” fearful of the stress it can cause. Sometimes, as with most bombs, it pays to drop it even if you get hit too, as the opponent may not account for that possibility."},
     "Electronic Baffle":{"rating":2,"text":"Electronic Baffle is a deceptively strong card. It is very powerful when combined with effects that cause self-stress or self-ion. For only one point, on the right pilot, Electronic Baffle can be game changing. Simply using it to remove stress after executing a stressful maneuver can be worth it on a ship with high hit points. Bear in mind to avoid using Electronic Baffle on ships with high agility and low hit points, as the damage dealt by this card can be crippling there. Look to try Electronic Baffle on Lambda-Class Shuttles and unique G-1A Starfighters among other ships."},
     "Overclocked R4":{"rating":2,"text":"The stress caused by Overclocked R4 is a significant downside, but the upgrade is only one point, so it is easy to squeeze into a list that can utilize it effectively. It is similar in effect to the R4 Agromech, but for half the cost, and with a downside."},
     "Systems Officer(Crew)":{"rating":1,"text":"While free actions are always worth looking at, this one is a little limiting. Requiring a green maneuver and the other friendly ship to be at range 1 of you does make Systems Officer somewhat difficult to use. It definitely can find its place on a TIE Shuttle titled TIE Bomber, sometimes paired with a Fleet Officer (Crew) to help assist ordnance carriers unloaded their missiles/torpedoes."},
	"Shadow Caster":{"rating":2,"text":"This is a very powerful title upgrade. While it is a little on the expensive side for 3 points, it inflicts an automatic tractor beam token on an enemy that is hit by the Lancer-Class Pursuit Craft’s attack. This is exceptional, as the ability to reposition the enemy ship (if it is a small ship) can be game-changing. However, to get the most out of this ability, this title should be equipped to higher PS ships (or at least it should be equipped to the highest PS ship in the squad), as the reduced agility caused by the tractor beam token can be exploited by the rest of the ship’s wing- mates."},
	"Fanatical Devotion":{"text":"When defending, you cannot spend focus tokens. When attacking, if you spend a focus token to change all %FOCUS% results to hit results, set aside the first focus result that you change. The set-aside %HIT% result cannot be canceled by defense dice, but the defender may cancel %CRIT% results before it. During the End phase, remove this card."},
	"I'll Show You the Dark Side":{"text":"When this card is assigned, if it is not already in play, the player who assigned it searches the Damage deck for 1 Damage card with the Pilot trait and may place it faceup on this card. Then shuffle the damage deck. When you suffer critical damage during an attack, you are instead dealt the chosen faceup Damage card. When there is no Damage card on this card, remove it."},
	"Suppressive Fire":{"text":"When attacking a ship other than 'Captain Rex', roll 1 fewer attack die. When you declare an attack targeting 'Captain Rex' or when 'Captain Rex' is destroyed, remove this card. At the end of the Combat phase, if 'Captain Rex' did not perform an attack this phase, remove this card."},
	"A Debt To Pay":{"text":"When attacking a ship that has the 'A Score to Settle' Upgrade card, you may change 1 % result to a %CRIT% result."}
